I also want to thank my technical editor, Jason Simanek; I’m so grateful that our  nally able to collaborate, and I’m so  glad that you were up for the challenge when it arrived. e content of this book has been reviewed by a few enthusiastic reviewers who  essly donated their time and intelligence for no more payment than what I  presume to be a premature satiation of their curiosity and what follows. So, thank you Chris Duesing, Zack Gilbert, Jacob Rus, and Paul Stamatiou.A great deal of useful knowledge is still locked up in libraries around the world, but the incredible amount of information and visual resources freely available on the Internet made writing this book much easier. So, thank you to all the great contributors to the Internet, from Wikipedia contributors, to bloggers, to photographers and illustrators who make their work available under a Creative Commons license on Flickr, Wikimedia, or anywhere else.  uence of my  ank you to Arthur Croyle, who was the best teacher I could have had to teach me about the origins of typography in ank you also to Gary Tartakov, whose lectures shared a socioeconomic  ank you to Paula Curran, whose methodical approach to design problems was an inspiration.01<em>9781119998952-ffirs.indd  v01</em>9781119998952-ffirs.indd  v7/27/11  7:03 PM 7/27/11  7:03 PM  uence of artists, authors, designers, architects, teachers, and entrepreneurs, as well as anyone, anywhere, ever, who has had the bravery to truly explore what he or  er the world. I will certainly leave out someone deserving of  mention, but here is my attempt: Jan Tschichold, Robert Bringhurst, Malcom Gladwell, Seth Godin, Tim Ferriss, Steve Jobs, Vincent van Gogh,  anks to all of you, to the   re, and to anyone who ever did  anything novel and creative thereafter and taught someone else about it. is book probably never would have been written were it not for an unlikely chain of events that brought me the privilege of living and working in Silicon  at time exposed me to the  most creative cowboys and cowgirls I’ve ever encountered, so thank you to all of you and to everyone I ever met who was like you but didn’t happen to live in  Cannon and Jon Stevenson for getting me  there. Also, thank you to Vinnie and Kristine Lauria, Noah Kagan, Paul Bragiel, and Ramit Sethi for being inspiring in your own ways. I would have put all of you in the preceding paragraph, but because I know you personally, that would have been weird. ank you to Ryan Halvorsen, Joe Avella, and Matt Taets for being inspiring  ank you to Ziad Hussain for saying one  statement that became the impetus for this book.Finally, thank you to you, who is standing there, or sitting there, or lying there, reading this book or receiving these ideas and concepts as brain input through  e presence of your eyeballs (or synapses), the  beating of your heart, the encouraging words – or the constructive criticism – you have provided through blog comments, tweets, e-mails, or taking the time to see me in person have powered me through what has been the biggest project of my life thus far. I’m so thrilled to share this with you, and I’m blown away  ank you so, so much. 01<em>9781119998952-ffirs.indd  vi01</em>9781119998952-ffirs.indd  vi7/27/11  7:03 PM 7/27/11  7:03 PMContents1 Design

I had terrible handwriting. It looked like a woodchuck had barfed a bunch of twigs onto a piece of paper. So, each quarter, when I was sent home with my report card, it was full of A’s and B’s . . . and one C-, in penmanship. Never having been one to blindly accept convention, I asked why it even mattered if I had decent handwriting. It’s probably no surprise that I thought handwriting was “stupid,” even “a waste of time.” I was too young to respect the merits of something at which I had no hope of succeeding (though seriously, grading on penmanship is stupid and a waste of time).No matter how many times I asked, I was always told the same thing: “When you grow up and get a job, you’ll need to be able to communicate clearly. You need good handwriting to communicate clearly.” ank goodness computers took over. My handwriting is still terrible. Oh, I can draw letters, but I certainly can’t write them.Today I understand that at the root of my educators’ intentions was something valuable: Clear communication is critical to success. Luckily for me, I rarely have to rely upon my handwriting to communicate clearly. I can simply type an e-mail, make a slide presentation, or write a book, and it will be rendered in years ago, and they still carry words with strength and clarity today.Additionally, I have spent years studying the subtleties of visual communication. I passed countless boring Nebraska days as a child, drawing in my room. I got my degree in graphic design, while exhausting the university library’s supply of typography and design books – skipping keggers so I could conduct experiments with typography and geometry. I studied the very origins of modern typography in the ruins of the ancient Roman Empire. I’ve even discussed the hidden meaning of something as simple as a brick or a piece of rm. Finally, I’ve implemented the 03<em>9781119998952-intro.indd  1 03</em>9781119998952-intro.indd  17/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 2fruits of all this practice and analysis in the fast-paced environment of Silicon Valley startups. Design and visual communication is so deeply embedded in my brain that I’m hardly aware of its presence. My handwriting still sucks, though.Design as LiteracyOne evening, I was “moworking” in a cafe with my friend Ziad, coding some design tweaks to the WordPress template for my blog. Ziad always has a way of saying abstract things that break my concentration and split my brain wide e people who know it can’t seem to explain it. It’s like if you want them to teach you something about design, they just chalk it up to talent.”Ziad’s comment did strike me as interesting, but the true weight of it took about a year to sink in. First came the realization that someone who wasn’t a designer by trade would actually want to learn about design. Being able to design was something I had taken for granted. It was a great skill to have, especially when creating my own apps or participating in weekend hackathons, such as Django Dash or Rails Rumble. I could create this perception of quality, this value, out of thin air. But, not being much of a back-end coder, I was envious of the fact that my design wasn’t worth a thing without the magic robot words behind it, which developers knew how to create. e whole reason  ered the consequences of poor handwriting was because  e only reason that I could write anything at all was that I was literate. is idea sounds very simple, but it’s pretty novel in the scope of human history. Most people today know how to read and write, but even just a couple hundred years ago, this was not the case. For people to learn how to write, they had to know how to read. For people to learn how to read, they had to have access to writing. To have access to writing, someone with the ability to read and write would have to produce something with writing in it, like a book. ordable to common people in the  03<em>9781119998952-intro.indd  203</em>9781119998952-intro.indd  27/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMINTRODUCTION 3next hundred years, but before Gutenberg’s Bible, books had to be written by hand. So, it’s no surprise that few people, aside from the clergy, knew how to read or write. erent. Not only can most of us read and write, but we don’t even have to worry about our handwriting. Desktop publishing, and even the ability to publish on the Internet, is available to the majority of people in the industrialized world.Not only can we publish our words, but we can design them. We have access to thousands of fonts. We can change colors and sizes of fonts with a few clicks. We can edit and publish photos and illustrations alongside our words. yers, postcards, and PowerPoint presentations complete with animations. We can create blogs, posters, and even ee mugs. But few of us are design literate. Sure, matters of design taste are starting to ere are backlashes over ugly fonts, such as Comic Sans results in miscommunication. Fonts, colors, layout, and the proper use of white ect how our message is conveyed, and nearly all of us have the  e world is in need of design literacy. The Hacker AttitudeNo group stands to gain more from design literacy than hackers do. No, I don’t mean computer geeks who break into networks and steal passwords. I don’t even necessarily mean software developers. I mean the renegade group of entrepreneurially minded people who are transforming the way we live, work, and interact. ough the term hackera particular group of computer and software enthusiasts, to many, the term has a broader meaning. An article by Eric Steven Raymond entitled “How to Become a Hacker” (www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) ve tenets of the hacker attitude: 03<em>9781119998952-intro.indd  303</em>9781119998952-intro.indd  37/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 4> e world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. > No problem should ever have to be solved twice.> Boredom and drudgery are evil.> Freedom is good.> Attitude is no substitute for competence.In short, a hacker values knowledge and learns whatever he needs to learn to achieve his vision. In today’s world, that often means learning at least a little coding, but the hacker attitude can be applied to problem solving of all kinds. ey do whatever it takes to  ey value skills and knowledge over titles and experience.At the forefront of the hacker movement is the Hacker News community (<a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com\">http://news.ycombinator.com</a>), a news aggregation site contributed to by followers of Paul Graham’s Y Combinator entrepreneurial incubator e program tends to fund small teams of hackers who have used their skills and hacker attitude to build cool products that solve problems: UserVoice (www.uservoice.com) democratizes customer support; Reddit (www.reddit.com) democratizes news; Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) provides an easy, automatic backup solution; and AirBNB (www.airbnb.com) turns extra bedrooms into places for travelers to stay. ey build products and businesses that not only communicate, but that users interact with and use to communicate with each other.

Hackers know that in order to compete against corporate behemoths with just a few lines of code, they need to have good, clear design, but the nd.  ey might hire a designer to help them out, but good designers are expensive and, when you’re bootstrapping a startup, you just don’t have the money to spend.  culty in learning design is probably that designers  culty articulating the process through which they make decisions. Many designers are, in fact, born with some degree of innate talent and interest in design, and, through countless hours of practice and experimentation, they’ve developed their particular approach to design. As a result, much of the design advice that exists is either too simple or too complicated. Have you ever heard anyone tell you simply to “use white space,” for example? If you don’t get it, she may just shrug her shoulders and say that she was just born knowing how to design.But the truth is, there really is a thought process – a decision-making e nuances of white space, for example, are  Chunks of white space are a part of compositional forces, which I’ll explain in With this book, I hope not just to provide you with simplistic rules about design, but to expose the methodical thought framework that I’ve developed from years of experimentation and analysis – a thought framework that I implement even as I collaborate with a team of developers on launching a product in a single weekend, or create a design solution for a client with limited funding. By “reverse-engineering” the design process, I hope to provide you with knowledge that can sustain you across a variety of situations.03<em>9781119998952-intro.indd  503</em>9781119998952-intro.indd  57/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 6If you want to learn to create great design yourself, if you want to gain design literacy, there simply is no way to do so with lists of rules. Instead, I want to provide you with a new set of eyes through which you can see the world anew. ed with the very next design that you create.

Good design has clearly been fundamental to the success of many of the world’s largest companies, and interest in and awareness of design has exploded during the past couple decades. But exactly what kind of impact can design have? More important, what really  nes the bounds of design?Skillful use of good design can create experiences that are emotionally moving. At the same time, good design – through improved communication and clarity  e characteristics of good design can bring  uence the decisions  ect emotions, build  credibility, and earn trust.

Because people-watching in the Pantheon gives you the opportunity to see the reactions of people who are walking into rst time.  rst time – though  erent for everyone – follows a predictable pattern: He walks through the  doors, in a hurry, guidebook in hand and comfortable sneakers on his feet. en, once he looks up, everything about his demeanor changes. He begins walking in slow motion. His head falls back limply on his neck, as if he were a  rst time. His jaw drops, and at some point, a “wow” and a sigh of amazement manage to escape his mouth. He may lift a camera to his eyes – in an attempt so feeble as to be entertaining – hoping that he may later relive the experience at will. is is why I loved to people-watch in the Pantheon.

What Design Really IsSteve Jobs once said, “In most people’s vocabularies, design is a veneer. It’s interior decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product.” It’s this layering, the interconnectedness erent factors, that manifests itself in the impact of the Pantheon. e emotional reactions that I witnessed over and over in the Pantheon are  e Pantheon, the current design of which was  tting that walking into the building would be an awe-inspiring experience. If it’s good enough for Venus, the goddess of is intention behind the design of the building – the impact it was meant to have – is nitely one of the “layers” that Steve Jobs was referring to. e way that the interior of the Pantheon achieves this reaction is through conceptually representing the heavens. Emperor Hadrian wanted those who is is the house of the gods, after all.  e interior does this by being in the form of a perfect sphere – it is as tall as it it remains the tallest unreinforced concrete dome in the world – nearly two oculus is is how the Pantheon has such an impact. Upon entering, you’re enveloped by Part of the impact of the Pantheon comes from the relationship between this incredible spatial experience and the materials used to create it. To achieve this form, the Pantheon pushes the limits of the materials from which it is built, which helps explain why a dome of this height hasn’t been created with the same technology since. So much reinforcement is needed to keep this dome 05<em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  1105</em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  117/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 12FIGURE 1-1 e Pantheon features the world’s tallest unreinforced concrete dome.

From St. Peter’s (just down the road from the Pantheon, in Vatican City) to the U.S. Capitol building, the dome of the Pantheon has inspired the design of buildings all over the world. is careful marriage of all the “layers” of design are what makes a design  e intentions of a design work together with the limitations of the technology used to create the design, as well as with harmonies of form, geometry, and color. All these pieces, all these layers, are inextricably linked with one another, forming the whole of what truly is design.What Design Is NotLike Steve Jobs said, many people think of design as some kind of afterthought – the upholstery on a couch, the logo on a business card, or the visual look of a button on a website. In pursuit of understanding design, many are led down  ey may  ect, repeatedly refer to lists of do’s and don’ts, or try adding visual elements to a design that do little but create clutter.To keep yourself creating good design, you need to learn how to understand all the layers that create great design. To create great design: Don’t draw ponies.Chances are, when you were in grade school, there was a kid in your class who everyone thought of as a good artist. His big secret was, he only knew how to draw one thing. In my third-grade class, there was a girl who could draw  owing ey had smooth, powerful muscles, and looked as if they could leap  e other kids in class would crowd around her as she drew pony  en, one day, someone asked her to draw a portrait.  e girl looked scared. “Yeah, draw him,” the 05<em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  1305</em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  137/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 14other kids cheered. So, reluctantly, she tried to draw the boy. As you can probably imagine, the resulting drawing looked nothing like the boy at all. His attened footballs. His hair was a random mess of scribbles. “I’m not very good at drawing people,” she said, sheepishly. Everyone seemed disappointed, but they still wanted to believe that she was a good artist. gure it out then, but eventually I got it. All the ponies the  e heads were at the same angle. Maybe the front hoof of each of the ponies was pulled up, as if the pony were ready to begin a gallop. She probably had just learned to draw a pony from one, maybe two angles – maybe from a picture in a magazine – and just repeated that over and over again. She was really good at drawing ponies this way.But the pony-drawing girl didn’t conceptually understand ponies. She didn’t understand the “layers” that make up a pony. Hey, she was in third grade, so that’s okay. But she didn’t understand pony anatomy, where all the muscles really were, or how they might change shape as the pony changed poses. e drawing of her classmate didn’t look right because she didn’t know human anatomy, either. She didn’t understand the way that tear ducts are on the inner part of the eye, or the way that an eyelid is constructed, or exactly how they tuck underneath the eyebrow ridge. She didn’t understand how individual hairs on a person’s head interact with each other and clump together. She didn’t understand technically how these things worked, she didn’t understand how a viewer perceives these things, and she didn’t understand how to use a pencil and paper to bridge the gap between these two worlds.Of course, she didn’t understand these things – she was in third grade. Probably, someday, she progressed as an artist, or maybe today she’s the most famous artist in the pony world. e point is that to truly be adept at designing something, you have to understand how it works. You have to understand the nature of what you’re building, how what you’re building is perceived, and how you can use your tools to make your vision happen. Otherwise, you aren’t designing. You’re creating a veneer. You’re drawing ponies. Don’t draw ponies.05<em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  14 05</em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  147/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMCHAPTER ONE WHY DESIGN MATTERS 15The Layers of DesignIt’s important to understand the layers that make up a design, because getting those layers to work together is the key to creating designs that look good, that uence your users. On the web, more than anywhere else, using the layers of design appropriately is critical to success. People are exposed to more information today than ever before, and there just isn’t enough time or attention for us to process all of it. So, we use shortcuts to decide what is deserving of our ever-more-precious attention.In psychology, these shortcuts are called heuristics. Heuristics help us solve complex problems and make complex decisions by using “rules” that are either programmed into us by evolution or learned from our own experiences.If you see a pair of shoes that you’re considering buying, you’ll immediately make a judgment on whether this brand of shoes is for you. How does the way ect the look of the shoes? Do the colors appeal to you? Is it your style? You use heuristics based upon how similar these shoes are to shoes that you’ve had past experiences with. ese heuristics are in heavy use as people make decisions on the web. We make split-second judgments about how much we trust a news site to give us accurate information, how much we trust an e-commerce site to process t will use our money wisely.It turns out, in all these cases, design is the single most important heuristic we process when deciding whether a site is credible. uence design are countless, with fuzzy boundaries. You  erent design experts what factors manifest themselves in a  erent sets of answers, they would all pretty much cover the same things. Here are some of the layers of design that I’ll talk about in this book.05<em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  1505</em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  157/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 16How design affects credibility on the webIn a study done at Stanford University, B. J. Fogg and his colleagues presented participants with two websites and asked them to rank the sites’ credibility, as well as provide comments about what they based their rankings upon. uence in participants’ ratings of the credibility of the websites in the study. An incredible 46 percent of all comments about the credibility of the sites were related to design. Participants said trustworthy sites were “more professional looking,” had a “higher-quality look and feel,” or  cally mention the color schemes or choices of fonts in sites that looked credible to them.Although well-designed sites enjoyed high credibility ratings, sites that were poorly designed were viewed as less credible. Participants didn’t trust a site if it was “not very professional looking,” if the “design [was] sloppy,” or if it looked “like it was put together ve minutes.” But just as drawing a pretty pony doesn’t make you a good artist, creating a pretty website doesn’t make you a good designer. Participants were skeptical of sites that looked inappropriately polished, giving negative comments suggesting that certain sites looked as if they were “designed by a marketing team.”The design of a site has to be appropriate, and considering all the layers that make a good design is critical in creating effective designs.Aside from the visual look of sites being important to their perceived credibility, the results of Fogg’s study also suggested that some of the more subtle aspects of design also were extremely important. Comments about the information design and structure of the sites in the study were the second most common, comprising over 28 percent of all the comments processed. Participants praised some sites for being “well organized,” while criticizing other sites because the “information [was] badly presented.”So, together, the visual look of a site – along with the way the information was organized – accounted for nearly 75 percent of all comments about whether participants trusted a site or not. Moreover, the participants’ comments were sensitive to design that was inappropriate for the site in question.Users know when you’re drawing ponies, so to create successful design, you need to understand how the layers of design interact.05<em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  1605</em>9781119998952-ch01.indd  167/27/11  7:02 PM 7/27/11  7:02 PMCHAPTER ONE WHY DESIGN MATTERS 17Purpose e Pantheon was built as a temple of the gods, the iPod was built as a portable device for playing music, and every website or application you create has its own set of purposes.  e forms   ciency in demonstrated by the skeptical comments toward inappropriately polished design in Fogg’s study (see the earlier sidebar), these economic factors help dictate the quality of design that a particular artifact should have. e purposes and intentions of a design interact with the characteristics and talk about how you can account for cultural color considerations.Every user needs to be able to access information clearly, and this erences between various fonts in historical context.

When you hear it called  that, it probably brings to mind a lot of what people think of design as – the veneer of design. But in many ways, the aesthetic decisions of design are invisible. e geometric relationships between things in a design are not something you can see, but they make a huge impact on the visual harmony, the sense of organization of content, and the overall “clean” feeling of a design. I’ll talk how these geometric relationships work with other hidden principles of design e colors we use in designing are, of course, visible. But designers make some important though invisible decisions when working with colors.

Visual characteristics are certainly components of design, but they are products of many factors. e bounds between design and other related disciplines are fuzzy, but for the purposes of this book, I’ll be talking primarily about visual design. Visual design concerns itself with the visual look – or the “beauty” – of a product. Visual design, as the name implies, is mostly associated with things that you see, such as the arrangement of design elements, the look of typography, or the ected by some pretty concrete things, such as product goals, culture, or technology.I’ll be talking about all of these factors in greater detail later in the book. In uenced, I’ll explain how hidden geometric and compositional forces create a sense of these factors can work together to create a sense of ordered visual importance of colors, and the ways that we organize and represent colors with various technologies, interacts with our cultural and cognitive responses to colors. Finally, in the appendices, I’ll cover some of the details of typographic expression through various font styles and through subtle details of typographic etiquette.By understanding a “reverse-engineered” view of these various factors, you’ll be well equipped to approach design with a lucid understanding of what makes a design attractive. Visual design will no longer be a mysterious and seemingly arbitrary production of innately gifted individuals. Like the exposed structural elements of the Golden Gate Bridge, you’ll begin to see the framework of decisions that produce beautiful, timeless, or sometimes just-good-enough design work.06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  2006</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  207/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMCHAPTER TWO THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN 21But this knowledge won’t come in the form of quick tips, top-ten lists, or ective forms of these are rare, and they just don’t get you that far.

You’ll start seeing the hidden geometric relationships that make one vast expanse of white space enliven a design, while another leaves it feeling dead (see understand how they interact, changing the prominence and meaning of one ers I’ll provide this new set of eyes with guidelines whenever possible. Some rules of visual design happen to exist by their own merits. But mostly, I hope to provide a foundation on which to grow. You’ll have a visual vocabulary with which to interpret designs that you think are beautiful – or not so beautiful. You’ll be as uent in breaking down the design of the latest startup’s landing page from TechCrunch as you are in interpreting a Monet at the Guggenheim. But to get started in understanding these various facets of visual design, you need to have some understanding of the factors that surround and shape visual design.Visual Design and Its Relation to User Experience DesignWithin the context of designing websites or applications, visual design is a component of the discipline of user experience design. User experience design concerns itself with anything relating to a user’s interaction with a product. User experience design attempts to make products memorable and easy to use erent disciplines, including usability. user experience design (in the context of websites and applications). As you can see, visual design is intertwined with the content and usability of a product. Naturally, the content of a product is what a visual designer is really trying to 06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  2106</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  217/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 22 uence visual  ectively.FIGURE 2-1 Visual design is a component of user experience design and is uenced by other disciplines and components of user experience design.User Experience DesignUsabilityContentVisual Design Visual Design ed, and many other related disciplines overlap with these disciplines and fall within user experience design. Disciplines such as interaction design, human-computer interaction, information architecture, cognitive psychology, and human factors all play some part in user experience design.

I would then make some assumptions about the user of the hammer. Hopefully, my budget would allow for a little research to help me form these 06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  2206</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  227/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMCHAPTER TWO THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN 23assumptions. I’d assume that the user has a working hand, so I would design a handle. I would take into account that a pretty good amount of force is required to drive a nail into wood, so I’d make the head of the hammer pretty heavy and hard. Sometimes it’s hard to accurately hit a nail on the head, so I’d make the head of the hammer big enough to be a little forgiving but small enough that it wouldn’t be too heavy to swing with some degree of control.So, now I’d have the basic form of a heavy object on a stick. But there would rough testing of a prototype, I might notice that the head of the hammer tends to twist if I don’t hit the nail perfectly, so I’d be careful to balance the weight evenly.

Whether a product needs to be visually compelling to compete is up to market forces.Take for example, craigslist (www.craigslist.org), which has single- ed ad companies out of  e visual design of craigslist is ugly (or just nonexistent) to the point of legend.

Meanwhile, craigslist e success of craigslist can be attributed to the fact that it functions very well and addresses a tremendous pain point in the market.

Before the iPod, contact with the elegance of Apple’s design was reserved for its relatively small group of extremely dedicated followers. It was as if they all had one great hammer that everyone else thought was “too expensive.” But the iPod made available a very good Apple product at a price point that was more accessible. e iPod has played a big role in Apple’s stock outperforming Microsoft’s stock of the tablet market.At the time the iPod came out, most people were using their computers for ng the web and creating 06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  26 06</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  267/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMCHAPTER TWO THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN 27 ce was such a dominant software program, so important to doing business, getting people to switch to a Mac was nearly impossible. So, Apple went for a more emotional point by attacking music.“Music is a part of everyone’s life. Everyone. Music has been around forever. It People had been listening to music on their computers for a few years at that time, but the portable digital player market was just emerging. Many of the players that were on the market at the time of the iPod’s introduction were  cult to transfer music to, and had interfaces that were “unbelievably awful,” as Steve Jobs put it. Apple had an opportunity to get one of its products into the hands of consumers more easily than it could a personal computer, and it seized that opportunity with the iPod.building that trust, started to sell more personal computers, with its market share tripling.

Although Apple had introduced style to computing with the multicolored iMacs (which was a bit like designing a really pretty hammer), now Apple had an opportunity to introduce fashion where it really mattered: in a music device that people carried around next to their bodies.Music is an inherently emotional thing – it’s very personal. Combine that with the fact that a portable music player is something people carry with them, in public, and it’s almost like a fashion accessory.

In this section, I go into a very simple “reverse-engineer” of the Twitter user experience. You can be sure that Twitter went into far more depth than this in redesigning its service. But I want to give you an overview of the kind of structured thinking that takes place in the user experience design process.NOTEI can’t stress enough that there is no right way to do user experience design, especially when you’re working independently on a small project. What’s important is that you learn how to think about user experience, nd a process that works for you, and turn your vision into reality.

Name: Mike Occupation: Ruby on Rails web developer/entrepreneur  Quote: “I want to use Twitter to have intelligent conversations with intelligent people, and to promote and get feedback for my many web products. Sometimes, when I’m troubleshooting something, I like to ask people on Twitter to see if they have any advice.” Needs: Keep track of conversations; easily scan lots of tweets So, there you have it: Mike is a smart web developer, who is experimenting erent startups. He wants to stay in touch with everything that’s going on in the tech and entrepreneurship world (as well as in other news). He wants to connect with other smart people to have discussions and get (and probably provide) a little help from time to time. Chances are, you know a Twitter user similar to Mike. Hey, you might even be a little like Mike yourself.06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  2906</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  297/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 30You can see that even with just a few words, we already know quite a bit about our typical user, and quite a few things about how he would like to use our product.  gure out a somewhat complex interface. Also, he wants it to be easy to have conversations and to promote products.Use casesUse cases (sometimes called user stories ciently solve some of the most important issues and uses that your users typically have. Use cases may turn out to be very similar to, or exactly the same as, the user needs that you list in your user personas. A use case is essentially an imaginary situation that you anticipate your users will encounter regularly. By really sketching out this situation, and thinking about the situation in conjunction with your user personas, you can think in a very focused manner about solutions that will work well for a given situation.characters or less come streaming in, and there isn’t much structure to organize them. Sure, you can choose who to follow or even organize people into lists, e messages can have so  attached to them, though: A tweet can mention another Twitter user, be retweeted by another user, or be one of many in a conversation. Additionally, the essential content of a tweet may be a link to a piece of media, such as an image or a video, or have location data attached to it that shows where the user doing the tweeting is located. e trick for managing all this chaos is enabling the user to scan all these tweets,  ow of  e paradox is that trying to put any of this rich data into the stream of tweets would destroy the casual convenience with which a user can scan tweets in his stream. So, a solution had to be created that would enable the user to access this data, while still allowing the user to scan his stream of tweets.To really understand how best to allow all this, it’s helpful to create a few use cases that outline how a user might consume a tweet, and what considerations are at play in that particular case. Following is one such use case.06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  3006</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  307/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMCHAPTER TWO THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN 31 is case refers to situations where you see a tweet that begins with an @Reply, and you wonder what the person who wrote the tweet is replying to. You may have seen a tweet in your Twitter stream at some point that said something to ect of “@username I have that problem all the time. I prefer to just use Firebug.” Naturally, you have no clue what that person is talking about unless you can see what he’s replying to. So, you might sketch up a case that looks something like this: Case: What’s this in reply to? Description: Mike sees a tweet that says “@username But startups love extrapolating exponential growth curves.” Mike wants to know what the  e tweet may be a part of a conversation, so it would be nice to have some mechanism through which users can see all the tweets within that conversation. Additionally, Mike may not be familiar with the user who is mentioned in the tweet, so it would be nice to provide some information on that user. User quotes: “Hmmm, sounds like an interesting conversation is going on. I wonder what they’re talking about. Also, who is this @username person?” Requirements: Display tweet(s) that this tweet is in reply to; display tweet(s) that replied to this tweet; display information on the user mentioned in this tweet.Just from this simple use case – and there clearly could be many more – you can begin to understand why Twitter is laid out the way that it is. When you click on a particular tweet, a sort of “tweet information pane” pops out to the side, displaying information relevant to that tweet. For the preceding use case, you can see that listing all the tweets in a conversation on this pane covers the user’s needs. Additionally, simple biographical information related to a user can be displayed in this same pane. Mike (from our user persona) can still scan his Twitter stream 06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  3106</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  317/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 32FIGURE 2-3 e tweet information pane, which slides out when an individual tweet is selected, provides relevant information on a c tweet, while allowing the user to continue to scan his stream.Reproduced by permission of Twitter, Inc.Just by thinking about these most common use cases, a solution has emerged e tweet information pane can display media (such as an image or video) that is related to a tweet. is feature keeps users on the Twitter domain and allows them to get to the meat of what a particular tweet is really about.WireframesFrom this information, and a little more focused thinking, you can start to sketch out the “skeleton” of the front-end of the Twitter application. Usually, this part of the process is called wireframes, because it’s a simple layout with no air to it. It gives you and your team an idea of where everything in the application is going to be.Wireframes also can vary greatly in complexity, depending upon your project. Some people use mockup software such as Balsamiq to create functional prototypes. Other people like to draw wireframes in a vector drawing application 06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  32 06</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  327/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMCHAPTER TWO THE PURPOSE OF DESIGN 33 e. Some developers like to go straight to code and build wireframes from HTML and some simple CSS; this approach has the added advantage of creating something you can use in the next phase of the  do some combination of all the above.FIGURE 2-4 A very simple sketch can be enough to get your ideas ready for further development.What matters when wireframing is that you have some way to express your ideas without getting too caught up in minute and as-of-yet inconsequential details such as fonts and colors.Knowledge AppliedVisual design is intertwined with the other disciplines of user experience design. Because successful design relies upon sensitivity to the interconnectedness of these disciplines, it’s important to have an understanding of user experience e structured thinking of the user experience design process ensures that you’re meeting the needs of your user uences your visual design.06<em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  3306</em>9781119998952-ch02.indd  337/27/11  7:01 PM 7/27/11  7:01 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 34Here are a few things to keep in mind when integrating user experience with your visual design:> You don’t always need a great visual design to be successful.

But an understanding of this emotional response stems from an understanding of the tools, people, and philosophies that are behind the letterforms. Not understanding these factors makes choosing fonts a guessing game.In this chapter, I’ll explain how tools have shaped one of the most important elements of design: typography. I’ll show you how a mediocre font can become a terrible font when not used as intended. I’ll demonstrate how closely linked language is to typography, outlining how the visual representations of ideas and things have evolved into our modern alphabet. I’ll show you how, throughout time, tools and technology have shaped new letterforms that remain closely tied to the letters that came before. Finally, I’ll demonstrate why some of the longest-lived typefaces are incompatible with much of today’s technology.The Tragedy of Misuse: Why You Hate Comic Sans e most exaggerated and memorable example I can give for what can occur when the true intention of a font isn’t fully understood by its users is the story of Comic Sans.08<em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  3808</em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  387/27/11  6:58 PM 7/27/11  6:58 PMCHAPTER THREE MEDIUM AND FORM IN TYPOGRAPHY 39 e childlike handwriting font is so infamous, there is a movement to try to ban it. Mention its name to the common layman (aside from a preschool teacher), and you’ll likely get a chuckle. Mention it to a trained designer, and you’ll get a look of disgust. But what exactly makes Comic Sans so horrible?To illustrate the poor fundamentals of Comic Sans, I’ll compare it to Helvetica, which is such a beloved typeface that there’s a movie about it: HelveticaCheck it out!First, I should acknowledge that comparing these typefaces is a bit like  erent moods. Helvetica looks strong and serious; it’s perfect for signage. Comic Sans is usually used in situations where the user wants to look playful and casual; it’s better suited for preschool classrooms. ey both have relatively unmodulated strokes, meaning that the thickness of the strokes on the type doesn’t change ers from Garamond’s form, which has a modulated stroke. Comic Sans also has an unmodulated stroke, like Helvetica.FIGURE 3-1 Both Helvetica and Comic Sans have unmodulated strokes, whereas Garamond’s stroke is modulated.Modulated Stroke Garamond Unmodulated Stroke HelveticaComic Sans is modulation is a result of Garamond’s form being derived from that of scribed letters.

But this isn’t feasible in most computer applications, and it would do little to make up for the other blunders of Comic Sans. e typographic fundamentals of Comic Sans are very poor as used in high- resolution situations.

But with Windows 95, a personal computer, and a printer, you could use Microsoft Word to make your lost kitten poster and print it out at home. And, wow! You could use any font you wanted. What’s that? You don’t know anything about fonts? Of course not, because you’ve never had this power before. So, guess what font makes you think about your lost kitten?This is a monumental moment in history – right up there with the invention of printing. Common people suddenly had the power to typeset and print documents. No big deal for a while – some people got to enjoy making their own Christmas cards, birthday party invitations, and so on, and the small audiences of their families and co-workers suddenly had to put up with some ugly, clip-art-riddled Christmas cards.But then, gradually, over the next decade, the Internet got more and more popular, and yers posted in break rooms, Comic Sans was showing up on websites and even as the default font for many people’s e-mails. Now, anyone could write a message that could be read by millions, in Comic Sans. This actually happened when Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert wrote a letter regarding the dramatic departure of LeBron James . . . and used Comic Sans, resulting in a media storm over the poor font choice.Comic Sans is at the disposal of nearly everyone with a computer. But that doesn’t mean that we’ll always have to be subject to its awkward forms. The spread of Comic Sans – a pretty bad font – is the result of the spread of an inarguably good technology. Just as the advent of movable type eventually led to a spread of literacy, the advent of personal publishing should lead to the spread of design literacy – and with it, a populace too informed to stoop to using Comic Sans.08<em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  4408</em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  447/27/11  6:59 PM 7/27/11  6:59 PMCHAPTER THREE MEDIUM AND FORM IN TYPOGRAPHY 45The Shackles of the Typographer: The Unalterable Word roughout the history of typography, the forms of letters have been derived from the media and tools with which they were rendered. Since an organized ago, the written word has been a song of language, tools, and media, exibility, and spirit of its performers.One of the most important principles consistent with every good piece of design is that the designer has shown a mastery of her medium. In any medium – whether it’s a block of marble, steel and glass, or pixels – the designer has to work with strengths and limitations. Work with these characteristics, and the design stands a chance of being good; work against them, and the design has no chance.(www.core77.com), he said, “(T)he best design explicitly acknowledges that you cannot disconnect the form from the material – the material informs the form . . . .” e blinding sheen of Michelangelo’s David is made possible by the hardness of the marble with which it was carved.

But the resulting forward lean of the statue contributes to its imposing presence. uenced by building materials and technology.

Form also can’t be disconnected from language. Jan Tschichold, one stated this well in e Form of the Book: Since typography appertains to each and all, it leaves no room for revolutionary changes. We cannot alter the essential shape of a single letter 08<em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  46 08</em>9781119998952-ch03.indd  467/27/11  6:59 PM 7/27/11  6:59 PMCHAPTER THREE MEDIUM AND FORM IN TYPOGRAPHY 47without at the same time destroying the familiar printed face of our language, and thereby rendering it useless.In short, more dramatic words: “the typographer is chained more than any other artist by the unalterable word . . . .” So, no matter what the material, no matter what the decorative expression, an x will consist of two lines (or at least the visual suggestion of two lines) that cross e same restriction applies to all the letters in our modern alphabet, and all typography must submit to this limitation.By understanding this concept, you’ll hopefully see typefaces with new eyes.

But the challenges presented by creating movable type brought about entirely new forms. rst few fonts that were inspired by the Carolingian minuscule attempted to completely replicate scribed lettering, printers very quickly found that punchcutting (the process they used to create their type) lent itself to new forms, which are still used in much of today’s printed material.Punchcutting: The cradle of the unalterable wordType designers today have nearly no restrictions, aside from the “unalterable word,” to guide the shapes of their letters.

When designing something that conveys information, such as a blog or other website, or when designing anything, the main thing that the designer is trying to do is communicate information. Because of this central premise around which design is built, it’s critical that a skilled designer for the web understand SEO best practices. cally, the design of typography – has always been about the conveyance of information. Ensuring that the right audience gets that information is part of the responsibilities of the designer.Information accessibility in designThe early scribes of books worked tirelessly to create beautiful hand lettering that could ciency. At that time, very few people could read, much less even get access to a book. Books generally consisted only of religious texts read by the clergy and were extremely expensive and labor intensive to produce. But when Gutenberg invented the printing press, the cost of producing books started to drop. As a result, literacy began to spread.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9009</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  907/27/11  6:52 PM 7/27/11  6:52 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 91One pioneer of the spread of literacy was Aldus Manutius, who saw the advent of printing as an opportunity to spread and preserve the wisdom of classic Greek literature. So, Manutius set up his printing house in Venice, Italy, and employed Greek scholars to edit manuscripts and proof prints. He also employed the type designer, Francesco Griffo, rst italic typeface (which saved space) and fonts that have inspired some of today’s more popular fonts.Manutius worked tirelessly to spread Greek literature, and to do so, he needed to innovate a format that would sell well.What Manutius came up with would later evolve into what we today consider the paperback book. Most books to date had been large, heavy, and bulky, but Manutius created an octavo format that – at only 33⁄4 by 6 inches – could easily be carried around. It was an appealing book format that was at least inexpensive enough to be owned by the cials who lived in Venice at the time. Starting in 1501, Manutius printed octavo books from Virgil, Plato, Aristotle, and others, and was eventually granted a monopoly on Greek publishing by the Venetian government. uence on Western culture that it has, were it not for Aldus Manutius’s innovations. By producing a book format that worked for the people whom he wanted to reach, he was able to spread the information that he wanted to spread.Designing with such utility in mind was at the crux of the modern movement in typography. Jan Tschichold set out to standardize business communications in the modern ciency with his 1928 book, The New Typography. Besides proposing ling, Tschichold also proposed that business cards be printed with certain portions of led and sorted according to name, geographic location, or other pieces of information.This underlying idea of the spread of ideas through printing is still at the backbone of design. When you’re designing something, you’re trying to convey a message. Part of your mission as a designer is to get that message to anyone to whom it applies, especially if nd your message. continued09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  91 09</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  917/27/11  6:52 PM 7/27/11  6:52 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 92 e basics of SEO are stupidly simple. It seems like everyone who works with the web talks about SEO as if they know all of it, but it’s surprising to me sometimes how rarely SEO best practices are actually utilized. Here’s a very basic refresher of why SEO is important, how it works, and what you can do to make sure that you’re doing the best you can.NOTEI’ll be talking Google-centrically because Google will likely account for the vast majority of your inbound search tr c. Additionally, if you rank highly on Google, you’ll probably do pretty well on other search engines anyway. continuedThis important principle is often lost with modern designers. Designers and clients often nd themselves focusing on the aesthetic and experiential qualities of websites, while ignoring the underlying structure of the information. Ill-advised use of Flash, which locks away information where it can’t be accessed by search engines or accessed through a browser’s Find command, reduces the communicative reach of a website.I’ve seen some beautiful websites with very interesting information on them. But because they were built in Flash, you can actually copy and paste a string of text from these sites into Google and come up with no results at all. All that great information is locked away inside Flash. Even if Flash were used on these sites in a search-engine-friendly manner, once you got to them, you wouldn’t be able to use the browser’s Find command to scan the information for keywords of interest.For reasons of search engine friendliness and users being able to use the tool of the ts a designer to surrender to whatever limitations may be present in the combination of HTML and CSS. Granted, with the advent of HTML5, these limitations are becoming fewer and fewer, but in any case it’s best to work with HTML.The reason for this is that, besides the really visible parts of a design – the words and pictures and other content – underneath all that lies the semantic language of HTML, which turns information into a structured hierarchy that powers the web and its amazing nding capabilities. A designer should be aware of this information structure, so she can design with SEO best practices in mind and reach the intended audience.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9209</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  927/27/11  6:52 PM 7/27/11  6:52 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 93I’ve been writing with SEO in mind – and using best practices as best as I can –  c has steadily increased.

If you have a bicycle shop on a busy street, you’re going to sell some bikes. It doesn’t matter how high your prices are, or how rude your employees are, you’re going to sell some bikes. Likewise, if you rank highly on Google for “bicycles,” you’re at’s  c. I don’t want to make the mistake of assuming that everyone knows just what it means to rank highly on a keyphrase.

But just nd you. It has to be a keyphrase that people are actually searching for. My blog gets lots of  c for the keyphrase lump in mouth because that’s what people search for when they have a mucocele (basically, a clogged salivary gland). Most people don’t search for “mucocele” because they don’t even know what one is – until they get a lump in their mouth and search for it.Ideally, each page on your site should compete well on a couple keyphrases that are descriptive of the content on your site, that have reasonable search volume, and on which you stand some chance of competing.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9409</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  947/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 95 nd out the volume of keyphrases by using the Google Keyword Tool (<a href=\"http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal\">http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal</a>).

Considering content and coding e content of a page – meaning the words within that page – has a huge impact on how well a page ranks for given keywords. If your target keywords don’t appear on your page, you’ll have a hard time ranking highly for that keyword. It’s not impossible, but I’ll get to that later. Relevant content has to be within your page – as code (meaning not as an image) – for search engines’ crawlers (the robots that read your pages) to read that content and rank you for is is a strong reason why Flash websites do poorly on search engines, and former print designers that just slice up a design on a e real content gets locked away, where crawlers can’t access it. ere are standards for writing HTML content, and they help rank chunks of content is helps search engines know the Ranking highly for your target keywordsThere are endless complex theories on just how a site ranks highly on search engines. Some of those theories have no basis at all. The truth is, nobody except little robots at Google knows just how a site ranks higher than another. What we do know is that the content of a page, how the page is coded, and the authority of other pages that link to a page – especially for the topic in question – are the most powerful dictators of how well a page ranks on search engines.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9609</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  967/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 97 erence between the important – and less important – information on a page and, thus, rank that page for various keywords.Following is a rundown of important content-based factors that dictate how your pages rank on search engines.URLBefore a search engine’s robot can read the HTML on your page, it will read the URL at which that page resides – and the content of this URL has pretty uence on how that page ranks on search engines. So, if my bike shop is at <a href=\"http://bikeshopinchicago.com\">http://bikeshopinchicago.com</a>, it will rank very highly on bike shop in Chicago. If I have a page for Cambria bicycles, I may want to put it at <a href=\"http://bikeshopinchicago.com/cambria-bicycles\">http://bikeshopinchicago.com/cambria-bicycles</a>. Note that you shouldn’t automatically pick your top keyphrase to be the domain that you purchase, because branding – and planning for the future expansion of your business – are both important. But you should have search engine (and human) friendly URLs that are in plain English instead of <a href=\"http://example.com/?p=34.Title\">http://example.com/?p=34.Title</a> tag e title tag of a web page is the strongest piece of information indicating what a page is about. Many businesses make the mistake of naming this is is why, if you search for “Welcome to Adobe GoLive,” you’ll get tons of results.) For any given page on your site, your title tag should contain the exact keyphrases that you your business name contains your target keyphrases, you could then follow that with your site’s name. So, if your business is David’s Bike Shop, your title should be “Bike Shop in Chicago – David’s Bike Shop.”FIGURE 4-17 Title tags have a strong uence on what keywords a page ranks highly for.Reproduced by permission of Arlo, Inc.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9709</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  977/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 98Meta tags e meta tags also contain some information that search engines give strong  erent meta tags, but the one that you should concern yourself with is the description meta tag.  contains, and search engines use its content not only to evaluate what a page is in search results.FIGURE 4-18 e descrip-tion meta tag is believed to hold some weight in search engine rankings and sometimes shows up in search results.Headers ese are ranked in  ere should be only one or may not be the same as your titletheir logos and link to their home pages – it depends on how narrow of a focus your site has. So, if you have a long document, full of text, it’s a good idea to break it up a bit by inserting some useful headers that also happen to contain some of your target keywords.Content: em, strong, imgFinally, you have the actual content of your page, which is hopefully helpful, interesting, and – incidentally – contains your target keyphrases. In addition to your target keywords, your content will probably bring in visitors on a number of “long tail” keyphrases that just happen to show up naturally within your great content.09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  98 09</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  987/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 99Within your content, you’ll hopefully have some images, because they’re useful for users. Much as the URL of your page is important to search engines, the lenames of your images are also important and should be descriptive. So, if you have a JPEG of a mountain bike, your image should be called mountain-bike.jpg, or – even better – include the color and brand: mountain-bike-schwinn-blue.jpg e alt attribute of your img tag also should be descriptive, so blue schwinn mountain bike would do. Don’t forget,  c from Google Image Search, if you use descriptive alt attributes. e italic and bold HTML tags ( em and strong, respectively) also hold higher authority in an HTML document than your plain content (which sits inside of p tags). When you italicize or bold words within your content, it lets search engine crawlers know that those words are important and relevant to the point of the page in question, so it’s a good idea to do a little of this – provided it supports the experience for your human users.Authority of linking pagesRanking highly on Google is ultimately all about the authority of your page or is concept of authority also applies generally to your site just being an authoritative site. Google uses a ranking called PageRank to measure how much authority a given page has, on a scale ere is a complex algorithm behind PageRank that you shouldn’t concern yourself with, but Google does provide a Firefox plug-in called Google supposedly is. Seven is considered a very high PageRank. NYT.com has a personal blog.FIGURE 4-19 Google’s Firefox toolbar displays the PageRank of a given page.A number of factors go into determining a given page’s PageRank. Although the actual algorithm is an ever-changing secret, here are a few factors that are widely accepted to be a part of the algorithm:09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  9909</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  997/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 100> Age of domain (how long the domain has been registered)> Authority (or PageRank) of pages that link to the page from other domains> Date of expiration of the domain (Is the domain expiring soon, or has the is is in one of  lings.)Content of linking pages and of anchor text of linksTo put it very simply, when other pages on a given topic link to your page of a related topic, search engines generally will rank you higher on that topic. If the PageRank of the page linking to your page is particularly high, Google will rank you higher for that.Also important is the actual anchor text (the content between a tags) of the link that links to your page. So, a link that says “Bike Shop in Chicago” will do more to rank “David’s Bike Shop” higher for searches for “bike shop in Chicago” than if the anchor text says “David’s Bike Shop.” e a tag also has a couple of attributes, such as the title attribute, which can have descriptive text applied to it. I haven’t seen anything to make me think that using this title attribute helps with SEO, but it certainly wouldn’t e rel attribute can have a value of nofollow, which tells Google’s crawlers not to follow the link and, therefore, not to give the page any extra authority based upon the link. Most blogs give all links in comments a rel=“nofollow” attribute to discourage SEO-minded spammers from exploiting the comment functionality.Everything in moderation all your pages full of keywords to the point that they didn’t make any sense. You might also contact  all your pages full of links – full of your keywords – to other pages. You might even obscure these links by making them the same color as your background or hiding them with CSS.Using some of these tactics in extreme moderation may even help you a little bit, but anything more than that will be heavily frowned upon by Google. It 09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  100 09</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  1007/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMCHAPTER FOUR TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE 101supposedly takes very sophisticated measures to detect use of these tactics and will downgrade a site for doing so – which is something you do not want to ere are tons of shady tactics for getting links. As a general rule of thumb, if it feels like it’s deceiving someone, Google probably has some way to detect it and you can bet they won’t like it.Getting the content, getting the linksHaving a site full of relevant keywords, and being linked to by sites with relevant keywords, is a means to an end, not an end itself. You achieve this by using good coding practices and generating useful and compelling content that others want to link to.Here are a few legit ways – that Google doesn’t frown upon – to get content and links to your site:> Have a blog. To rank highly on keywords, it’s pretty much a must to have useful content, rich with your target keywords, that is updated on a regular basis. A blog is the best way to have these attributes. Unfortunately, Google still ranks some pretty awful content really high, so I’d say that having some not-so-well-written content is better than having none at all – but hopefully this will change when they improve or someone gets around to building a better search engine.> Get into directories. DMOZ is the highest-authority directory, and it’s ere are plenty of paid  nitely high- authority are Yahoo! Directory and Business.com.

A really thorough, information-rich how-to is a good example, but writing posts that are very controversial works well, too (unfortunately). Such posts then get shared on social news sites such as Reddit, and on Facebook and Twitter. 09<em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  101 09</em>9781119998952-ch04.indd  1017/27/11  6:53 PM 7/27/11  6:53 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 102Do lots of research and make some pretty graphs, and your chances of getting lots of links increases again.> Find your audience.

Our eyes seem to be naturally attracted to a sense of order in the things that we see. You may have heard someone talk about proportions before: “His nose is out of proportion with the rest of his face.” But what does it really mean for something to be “out of proportion”? Better yet, what makes something “in proportion”? er, a great deal of study and thought has been given to proportions throughout history. What is it that makes the face of a model beautiful? Similarly, what is it that makes a sculpture beautiful? What makes a logo beautiful? Beautiful proportions are a hidden but important factor in all these cases.In this chapter, I explain what proportion is and how proportions have been is is a topic that has fascinated many philosophers, mathematicians, and, of course, artists and designers for millennia. Proportional patterns have been found in nature, as ese patterns have been studied and then used deliberately in an attempt to crack the formula for beauty.As I’ll explain, although understanding proportional relationships can help you understand what makes things beautiful, there is no one particular formula that you must follow. Instead, like many things in design, there are more simple guidelines that can get you creating beautiful design more consistently.So, the subject of proportions in design is in no way something that you must obsess over to create successful design. If it happens to light up your brain, erent approaches to geometric proportions may fascinate you for hours at a time – or a lifetime.You’ll gain a general understanding of proportions through this chapter, and how to create interesting compositions using a few key design principles, and information.11<em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  106 11</em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  1067/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMCHAPTER FIVE FOOL’S GOLDEN RATIO: UNDERSTANDING PROPORTIONS 107What Is Proportion?Proportion, ned, is how the size or magnitude of one thing relates to that of another related thing.

But to understand how to use proportions, you need to understanding which proportions are interesting and how those proportions are used.The Broken Promise of the Golden Ratio e opening sections of this chapter are admittedly very basic. I’ve introduced proportions in the simplest way possible, and there’s a good chance that all along you were waiting for me to mention the golden ratio.Ask just about anyone what proportion is considered to be the most beautiful in the world, and if he has any opinion on the matter at all, he’ll likely tell you that it’s the golden ratio. Or, at least, that’s what he’s heard. e golden ratio has fascinated scholars, mathematicians, and artists for millennia. Whether the ancient Greeks truly understood its potential aesthetic properties is still up for debate, but this fascinating irrational number is believed to have been discovered by Pythagoras in ancient Greece in the sixth e golden ratio, often denoted by the Greek lowercase phi ( ) is expressed algebraically as follows:Segments of a line divided according to the golden ratio will interrelate to each e length of a + b is to segment a as the length of a is to segment b11<em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  110 11</em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  1107/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMCHAPTER FIVE FOOL’S GOLDEN RATIO: UNDERSTANDING PROPORTIONS 111FIGURE 5-4 A line divided according to the  golden ratio will  consist of two  e long segment (A) has the same  proportional  relationship with  the entire line as  the short segment  (B) has with the long segment (A).AA + BB e golden ratio rectangle – which is famously believed to be found in nature, art, and architecture – is constructed by drawing an arch with a line the length of the  e farthest point this arch reaches  FIGURE 5-5 A golden ratio  rectangle, which  has proportions  of approximately  1:1.618, is  created by  drawing an arch  that has a radius  that extends from  the midpoint of a  square to an  opposite corner.1 e rectangle that lies outside the original square has the same proportions  is subdivision can continue on forever, which is why this ratio is so fascinating.FIGURE 5-6 Golden ratio rectangles can be progressively subdivided with a square ad  nitum.11<em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  11111</em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  1117/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 112The golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence: Similar, but different e golden ratio is very closely related to the Fibonacci sequence, which is a series of integers in which each subsequent number is the sum of the two . . .

So, if you’re simply talking about using geometry to guide aesthetic decisions (not an exact science, as I’ll demonstrate), it’s safe to use them interchangeably. I’ll simply refer to it as the golden ratio.11<em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  11211</em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  1127/27/11  6:51 PM 7/27/11  6:51 PMCHAPTER FIVE FOOL’S GOLDEN RATIO: UNDERSTANDING PROPORTIONS 113The golden ratio in the human formOne of the more famous examples of the golden ratio at work is present in drawing based upon the work of Vitruvius, who wrote extensively about his belief that architectural proportions should be based upon the proportions of the human form.FIGURE 5-8 Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man is subdivided according to golden ratio rectangles. e relationships between the proportions of the Vitruvian Man and the golden ratio – and the interrelationship of the parts of the Vitruvian Man – are, 11<em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  11311</em>9781119998952-ch05.indd  1137/27/11  6:51 PM 7/27/11  6:51 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 114 ngertip of the model (a distance that is the same length as the height of the model), aligns perfectly with the navel. A second golden ratio rectangle – this time upright – aligns perfectly with the shoulder on the right side of the model.

Subdividing this remaining rectangle with another square lines up with the top of the shoulders and frames the head. e writings of Vitruvius, and Leonardo’s resulting drawing, fascinate architects and designers to this day and have inspired a great deal of geometrically rationalized design, art, and architecture. Although this has produced some impressive work, probably the better work occurs when the geometric relationships are merely incidental.Architect Le Corbusier used Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man to develop an entire architectural scale called Modulor, which he used in a number of buildings, such as  e parallax from the camera has likely caused some distortion in this image, but you can see that the elevation of the building is approximately two descending golden ratio  e bounds of the individual units, and the  uenced by the golden ratio rectangle.

Understanding these proportions can help you design in a way that is relevant to your audience.Proportions such as the golden ratio and the proportions I introduce here can be used to guide design choices in dividing information on a grid (which I talk as well as determining white space and type sizes.

Mouseover states that cause interface elements to pop out cue the user that they can interact further with that element. When a button visually pops out into the foreground – whether it’s through color or a drop shadow – it’s letting users know that they can press it.12<em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  14312</em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  1437/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 144 ough  ink Vitamin’s design is mostly solid colors, there is still some subtle  e most recent – and most prominent – blog post is thrust into the foreground because it is on such a dark background.

Like many things in the world, the concepts that design principles try to encompass are much more complex than ne them.

After your eye is drawn to the couple in the Seurat painting, you’re prompted to explore other parts of the composition. Your eye continually gets drawn back to the couple – because of their dominance – and then back throughout the composition again. e largest circle on my simple composition is dominant, in part, because it’s the largest element. (I’ll talk about some other ways it remains dominant as I introduce more principles further on in the chapter.) ink Vitamin also uses dominance in its design, again with its treatment of its latest blog post. As I mentioned earlier, the information for the latest blog post 12<em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  14512</em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  1457/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 146is in a prominent location, at the top left of the page, and is pushed into the foreground.

Dominance is also used through larger titles and dark icons.FIGURE 6-10 Dominance is used in the smaller “sub-compositions” ink Vitamin blogto call out important information.Reproduced by permission of ed SimilaritySimilarity means that various elements of a composition – their shape, color, line characteristics (smooth or jagged), or texture – are similar to one another. Similarity makes a composition compelling because, as your eye travels throughout that composition, it is constantly reminded of things that it has seen before within that same composition. Use of similarity also is a nice setup for the use of the principle of contrast (another principle I talk about more later).12<em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  14612</em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  1467/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMCHAPTER SIX HOLDING THE EYE: COMPOSITION AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES 147  e shapes that the  ed.

Rhythm is a bit more abstract than rst thing that you think about when you think about rhythm is music. Just as the repetition of a snare or kick drum at a consistent point in a measure of music, over and over again, creates a sense of rhythm in music, the repetition of a particular design element or characteristic throughout a composition create a sense of rhythm in design. Rhythm in a design keeps it interesting because – much like similarity – you’re consistently reminded of things that you saw earlier as you view the composition. But rhythm also can be a useful method of managing the principle of direction and of setting up an opportunity to use the principle of contrast (both principles that I’ll talk about more later).FIGURE 6-12 Similarity is used throughout the ink Vitamin site in the rounded shapes of the buttons, icons, and other interface elements.Reproduced by permission of ed  erect postures of all the people in the composition echo the vertical trunks of the trees.

For example, if something looks like sandstone – or actually is made of sandstone – then that is texture. Texture is related to similarity and rhythm in that if a shape is repeated enough times, and  ne enough scale, it generally creates a texture. Texture keeps a composition interesting because it provides an opportunity for the principle of contrast (which I’ll talk about soon) and can create a sense of depth in foreground/background relationships.Because the Seurat painting is composed of thousands of tiny dots of paint (a technique called pointillism), it has a strong sense of overall texture. Depending on how far away you view it from, this can look very rough or a little smoother – like sandstone.12<em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  150 12</em>9781119998952-ch06.indd  1507/27/11  6:50 PM 7/27/11  6:50 PMCHAPTER SIX HOLDING THE EYE: COMPOSITION AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES 151But there are some subtle changes in texture throughout the painting as well.

Unlike geometric proportions, which are simply good to know, understanding composition and mastering the use of design principles is absolutely critical to creating beautiful design. When someone says that a person “has an eye for design,” these design principles are what they’re talking about. Great designers know how to use design principles.> Look for design principles at work in everything you see. Next time you’re on a website that looks visually stunning, pay attention to its use of dominance in telling you where to look. See how direction is being used to guide your eye throughout. What other design principles do you see being used (or not being used)?> If you made a simple composition of your own in the last chapter, try experimenting with it to practice, at a very basic level, your use of design principles.

If they’re designing an interface for a blog,  e user needs to be able to navigate to any page that he wants, but at the same time, the articles on the blog need to be easy to read. Categories need to be easy to navigate to, and information about the blog and its authors need to be clearly accessible.Making these compositions visually compelling is important for getting new users to stay and for conveying a mood to visitors. But a compelling nd what she’s looking for. Many visual standards and user interface patterns have been established for designing on the web, and certain user expectations come along with them.For a user to be able to navigate through all the information in a website or application, that information needs to be clearly presented and have a clear hierarchy.What I Mean by “Hierarchy” e term hierarchy implies that information has a linear progression of e importance of a piece of information in an interface can change according to the use case. If you see a new blog post on a site that you read frequently, you probably aren’t that concerned with the date of that blog post. If you’re reading a technical how-to about software that is frequently updated, though, the date of the blog post may be very important to you.Although sometimes you can make some safe assumptions about the relative importance of pieces of information, visually organizing information is a much more nuanced process than simply ranking information by importance. e logo and title of the blog are at the top. Along with that is the navigation, and maybe even a logo for the name of the blog. In the HTML for the layout, this information is often encased in what is usually called the “header” of the blog.13<em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  168 13</em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  1687/27/11  6:38 PM 7/27/11  6:38 PMCHAPTER SEVEN ENLIVENING INFORMATION: ESTABLISHING A VISUAL HIERARCHY 169FIGURE 7-1 Most blogs have a layout generally  e various sections are arranged to establish a hierarchy.HeaderFooterMainSidebar Below the header usually lies the main content area.

Each of these comments is accompanied, possibly, by a photo of its author and a date and time stamp for the comment.To the side of the main content area is often a sidebar area, which typically lists categories, a function for searching content on the blog, information about subscribing to the blog, and maybe a few ads. e footer usually repeats links that are in the navigation in the header but also often includes other links such as one to the particular content management system (CMS) the blog is written in or what copyrights the author of the blog reserves. e various sections of a standard blog layout don’t so much rank things  er.13<em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  16913</em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  1697/27/11  6:38 PM 7/27/11  6:38 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 170Hierarchy is expressive ere is no way that you could accurately rank these pieces of information from most important to least important and have it apply to every situation. c than this. Pieces of information have personalities and relationships with one another. ere are linear distinctions such as the header tags of H1, H2, H3, and so on, but there are other tags such as blockquote and code that simply call out that the nature ers, rather than the rank of that information. Establishing a visual hierarchy is somewhat congruent to HTML in this way. Sometimes user needs or marketing objectives make certain information indisputably rank higher than other information, but there are many other erences between pieces of information that have to be expressed with  nesse.Many visual factors can affect hierarchyMany people who dive into trying to learn how to design make the mistake of trying to work with far too many visual factors when trying to establish a visual erent ways to  erentiate  erent pieces of information and design elements from one another. You can alter the white space or make changes in size, typeface, or visual weight. You can change colors, or use ornamentation such as rules, icons, or solid blocks of color.Unsure of how to proceed, many beginning designers try to change too many of these factors at once. Usually they change the factors that are the most visually obvious. If they’re creating a header in a blog post, they may change the font, make it larger, change the color, and add a rule or a background e big secret is, some of the least obvious factors – such as use of proportion in white space – are the ones that have the most impact.If you’ve never danced salsa in your life, and you were to try dancing to salsa music, what you’d come up with would probably not be pretty. Unless you 13<em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  170 13</em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  1707/27/11  6:38 PM 7/27/11  6:38 PMCHAPTER SEVEN ENLIVENING INFORMATION: ESTABLISHING A VISUAL HIERARCHY 171have incredible natural talent (or lots of experience dancing in other styles), rst watched some skilled dancers, learning by seeing would be very tough.

You have to learn the basic moves before you can tie them together with the more complex ones. But the basic moves of design aren’t as apparent and well known as the basic moves of dancing. ect the hierarchy of information are like dance steps that fall on the beats of music. If you learn to observe and practice each of them in isolation, you can more easily tie them together.Hierarchical Factors in IsolationEven the basic blog layout that I’ve presented is too complex of a song with e overall layout has a visual   ese  elds of information have hierarchical relationships with each other, but each is also full of hierarchical relationships.To teach you the basics of creating a visual hierarchy, we need a more basic informational hierarchy with which to work. I’ll use text from a basic lead-in to a blog post, as it might look on the home page of a blog. It holds the title of the blog post, a sampling of the body of the blog post, and a lead-in to read more of the blog post. It also holds metadata about the blog post, such as the publication date, the category, the author, and the number of comments on the post.13<em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  17113</em>9781119998952-ch07.indd  1717/27/11  6:38 PM 7/27/11  6:38 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 172It’s clear that some pieces of information here are more important than others. e title is the most important, because it tells you what the blog post is about.

You also may say that the post itself was posted “on” a particular date and time. e way that we talk about pieces of information speaks a bit to how those  er conceptually. White space er, we need to isolate the variables with which we can make those expressions. One of the most important, and maybe the most fabled, is that of white space usage. e term white space is usually used to describe any area that doesn’t have information, or some other design element within it. You’ve probably heard someone say that you should “use more white space” or that something “has too much white space.” But what does all this really mean?A piece of information with lots of white space around it will often look more important than other information. Two pieces of information that have very little white space between them will often appear to be related to one another. ects hierarchy, you need to hold all other variables constant. So, I’ll present a composition with all the (no bold or italic).Using a grid to manage white spaceTo make good use of the white space, I’ll employ some of the methods of working with geometry that I outlined in the last couple chapters.

Color tastes and meanings vary across cultures, and from individual to individual. In fact, the very notion of color is rooted in subjectivity. As I’ll explain in this chapter, what we perceive as color as a species varies from the  ere are colors we can see that, say, a dog cannot ere are other colors that other animals – such as birds – can see, that we cannot. Additionally, there are variations within the human experience of color. cations of color (such as the hexadecimal color system that powers the web) often don’t do color its full justice, and representations of color vary from medium to medium, and device to device.No matter how subjective of an experience color is, one thing is for sure: to use color lucidly, it’s very helpful – if not a requirement – to understand how color works.

What color is to you may not even be a color to me. As I’ll explain later, what color is to you probably isn’t a color to your dog. What color is to all those annoying pigeons downtown, surprisingly, may not be color to you.It could be argued that color isn’t color unless you can see it, but the color that the electromagnetic radiation that we perceive as color is the same electromagnetic radiation that pops a bag of popcorn in your microwave, sends tunes to your FM radio, X-rays your broken clavicle, or changes the channel on your television (with your infrared remote control).FIGURE 8-1 e colors that are visible to humans lie  c range of electromagnetic radiation.Sakurambo (<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia\">http://commons.wikimedia</a>. org/wiki/ User:Sakurambo) e electromagnetic radiation that humans can generally see is called the visible spectrum. 15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  19715</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  1977/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 198through a triangular prism disperses into the visible spectrum of color. By showing that portions of this spectrum traveled through an additional prism unchanged in color, and by recomposing this spectrum back into white light using a lens, he proved that this spectrum truly was the separation of white light, rather than colors somehow created by the prism. Before Newton’s experiments, scientists believed that white light was colorless. ough there are no clear separations between the colors within this spectrum,  ed the colors and arranged them in a circle. He chose to divide the circle into seven colors based on the belief of the ancient Greeks that colors are connected to the musical notes (there are seven notes in an octave) and days notes – arranged according to the Dorian mode in the key of D – assigned to their respective colors.FIGURE 8-2 Newton arranged the colors of the visible spectrum in a circle, according to musical notes.The Tricks Your Eyes Play e perfect division of white light into the visible spectrum of colors really only occurs in a vacuum. In the real world, there are all sorts of factors that come into play that make the light you see a little less pure. But, your eyes – or, more accurately, your visual system – play a few tricks to bring some consistency to the visual world.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  19815</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  1987/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMCHAPTER EIGHT COLOR SCIENCE 199Metamerism ough this “rainbow” spectrum may be very familiar to you, in your day-to- day world, you’ll almost never encounter such a pure representation of color. e colors that you observe in the physical world are spectra that consist of varying frequencies. Your eyes and brain approximate the color of a given spectrum, and this is how you see colors. er from another, they may appear to be the same  is phenomenon is called metamerism, and it’s the basis for how we are able to approximate and reproduce colors across a variety of media. A photograph of a red car may consist of spectra that vary from seeing that same car in real life, under sunlight, but thanks to metamerism, those colors look essentially the same.So, when you do see any of these pure colors from the “rainbow” spectrum, it’s because of this parsing that your visual system does. It senses the dominant color and causes you to experience that color. What you’re seeing in this book isn’t the pure colors of the spectrum. Instead, they’re printed on the page by a ecting the spectra of wavelengths that are hitting your eye. But your visual system still reads them more or less as pure colors.Color constancyColor constancy is another shortcut your visual system takes to make sense of what you’re seeing. Color constancy is a phenomenon in which your eye reads two instances of the same color as being the same color despite the fact that one instance is in light, and another is in shade. Notice, for example, that the parts fact that part of the balloon is in direct sunlight, and part of it is in the shade. ects.

Adelson (<a href=\"http://persci.mit.edu/people/adelson\">http://persci.mit.edu/people/adelson</a>)AfterimagesAfterimages are another interesting visual phenomenon. If you stare at the red is happens because the red color receptors in your eyes grow accustomed to the visual stimulation of red. When your eyes go back to a blank space, your receptors are still accustomed to seeing red in that part of your vision, so the visually opposite color is sent to the brain instead.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  200 15</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2007/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMCHAPTER EIGHT COLOR SCIENCE 201FIGURE 8-5 Staring at the red circle for 10 seconds, and then looking at the gray outlined circle, will result in a greenish- blue afterimage. e phenomenon of afterimages is related to the concept of complementary, or model believe certain pairings of colors, such as red and green, are the highest in contrast to one another and create a sense of vibration where they meet.Impressionists such as Vincent Van Gogh took advantage of this phenomenon by using contrasting colors, creating a sense of vibration and movement in eo, in  To exaggerate the fairness of hair, I come even to orange tones, chromes and pale yellow. . . .

To really understand the way we perceive color, and to understand some of the underpinnings of color theory that will be presented in the next chapter, it’s helpful to understand how the human visual system works.ConesYour retinas have millions of photoreceptors (the ones that adapt to create afterimages) called cones, which process colors within the visible spectrum. 15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  20115</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2017/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 202Other photoreceptors, rods, are responsive in dark conditions and do little, if any, color processing. ere are three types of cone cells in human eyes, and each type processes its own part of the visible spectrum (though there’s a great deal of overlap). Figure  ere are short- wavelength (S, or blue) cones, medium-wavelength (M, or green) cones, and long-wavelength (L, or red) cones. (When you look at how each of these cones relates to the colors in the diagram, you can see that the color names are merely approximate.) S cones are most sensitive to violet light, M cones are most sensitive to green light, and L cones are most sensitive to yellow-green light.FIGURE 8-6 e various cone types of the human retina handle their own respective portions of the visible spectrum, with some overlap. is combination of cone response allows us to distinguish about ten million colors, though some animals, such as birds, have extra receptors for ultraviolet light, which allows them to see a far wider range of colors.

In other words, it can process one or the other – either the color processed is more green, or it’s more red. e other type processes information from the S cones in an antagonistic manner with a combined signal from the L and M cones, so the color processed is essentially either more blue or more yellow.similar explanation on the blog A Smart Bear (<a href=\"http://blog.asmartbear.com\">http://blog.asmartbear.com</a>) summarizes what this system looks like.Because of this opponency, humans are unable to see color combinations such as green-red or blue-yellow. Although you learned in grade school that yellow and blue make green, some researchers believe that there exists a color that would appear both yellow and blue at the same time. Also, while red and green paint mixed together will give you a brown color, and red and green light mix to make yellow, some researchers believe that there is yet another possible color sensation that appears both red and green at the same time.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  20315</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2037/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 204FIGURE 8-7 e human visual system sends color signals from the three photoreceptor types to ganglion cells that process color in an antagonistic fashion.

Instead, our perception of purple comes from a combination of colors, such as red and blue, which – because of the way our ganglion cells process stimulus from our cones – actually can be perceived at the same time.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  204 15</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2047/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMCHAPTER EIGHT COLOR SCIENCE 205Whereas the visible spectrum exists linearly, the popular artist’s color wheel is arranged in a circular fashion, with purple bridging the gap between the FIGURE 8-9 e popular and familiar artist’s color wheel features purple, which exists as a combination of red and blue wavelengths of light. is color wheel is very important in the color theory behind art and design, Colorblindness erent forms of colorblindness that prevent them from  e most common type of colorblindness is red-green colorblindness, which occurs in as many as one in ten males.

For example, Photoshop has a nd tools that allow you to preview websites as they might appear to a colorblind person, or color palettes that simulate the colors visible to colorblind people. e degree to which you make preparations for colorblindness depend upon the needs and use cases of your project.

Color scientists have been ne the estimated ten million colors humans can see.One of the earlier attempts to represent all visible colors was the Farbenkugel t into a perfect sphere. In fact, there is a great deal of subtlety within how well the average human can erences between various colors. With some hues, there is a wider range of values – from light to dark – that we can perceive. As the world started to standardize; the visible range of colors needed to be represented numerically. is would be useful in science – in the description of soil color, for example – but is absolutely critical when representing color in computing.FIGURE 8-12 Philipp Otto Runge attempted to represent all visible colors in three dimensions with his Farbenkugel.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  20715</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2077/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 208Munsell e  cation of visible colors was that of Albert H.   ned colors based upon their hue (is it red, blue, and so on?), value (how dark or light is it?), and chroma (color intensity – for example, pastels are low chroma). Because the Munsell system is based upon the sensitivity of human perception, it is not uniform in shape, like the Farbenkugel e Munsell FIGURE 8-13 e Munsell color system codes colors according to their hue, value, and chroma.Jacob Rus (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jacobolus\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jacobolus</a>)  e  c measurement of human subjects’ response to color. Because of this, two colors erent hues but identical values within the Munsell system will be equal in perceptual lightness to the human eye.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  20815</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2087/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMCHAPTER EIGHT COLOR SCIENCE 209FIGURE 8-14 Because of the perceptual uniformity of the Munsell system, some colors have wider ranges of value and  e color space itself is not uniform in shape.SharkD (<a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia\">http://commons.wikimedia</a>. org/wiki/User:SharkD)Hue, saturation, and brightness e HSB (sometimes called HSV) color model is conceptually similar to the Munsell color system in that it distorts the range of colors into a cylindrical shape upon three axes (hue, saturation, and brightness), but HSB breaks down these values into equal ranges. Where the Munsell system has value ranges that vary (for example, yellow has a higher potential variation for chroma, or intensity, than do light purples), the HSB model has a potential range of saturation (similar to chroma) that is the same no matter what the hue.Because of this, the HSB model distorts the visible range of colors. So, if you’re have pure white. According to the HSB color model, white and bright red have the same Brightness, even though the actual perceptual lightness of white is higher than that of red. is is a problem when the HSB color model is used to create graphics where data is represented by colors, but, as I’ll explain in a bit, HSB (and similar color models) still remains one of the easiest available color models for picking a color that you imagine in your head.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  20915</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2097/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 210FIGURE 8-15 Sliding the Saturation bar on an HSB picker results in a changed perceptual lightness, while the Brightness value of the color remains is is a perceptually inaccurate depiction of the color.Lab color model e most popular color space – which is based upon the Munsell color system – is the CIELAB color model, which is represented in graphics programs, such as Photoshop, as “Lab” (L stands for lightness, and a and b stand for their own color-opponent pairs). When you adjust the a slider on a Lab color picker, you essentially choose whether the color is more red or more green. When you adjust the b slider, you choose whether the color is more blue or more yellow. Since the L slider stays in the same place, the overall lightness of the color stays the same.While being able to maintain a constant perceptual lightness is sometimes  cult to sliders on their lowest possible settings, which gives me a rich blue color. If I want to get a violet color, I have to slide the a slider all the way to its highest is does change the color to be slightly closer to violet, but I can now see that if I slide the L slider to the right a bit, I can get the color I was looking for.FIGURE 8-16 Trying to pinpoint a color on Lab color sliders is not an intuitive process. rst slide the H slider until it’s on violet, and then adjust the S and B nd the color I want. By changing modes to a web color picker, I can get the hexadecimal value. (Choosing a color from a web color picker is at least as unintuitive as choosing a color from a Lab picker, by the way.)15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  21015</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2107/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMCHAPTER EIGHT COLOR SCIENCE 211FIGURE 8-17 Pinpointing a color on HSB color sliders is very intuitive. You can select the desired hue, and then adjust accordingly.Color Models and Data-Driven Graphics e distortion present in a color model can be especially critical when creating data-driven graphics programmatically.

It was the talk of the neighborhood, and one time they even invited me over to watch a movie on it. I remember being fascinated by the fact that it was essentially just three lights – red, green, and blue – that were cast onto the theater screen. I couldn’t help but try blocking one light at a time. If I blocked the red light, the image came out a little blue. If I blocked the green light, the image came out a little pink. For some reason, I was never invited sh stew anyway.Obviously, my neighbor’s home theater system was working with the additive RGB color model that I just described. It cast three images on the screen, and they mixed together to make a full-color image. Blocking any one of the colors would result in an image that was tinted a combination of the other two colors. So, when I blocked red, the other two colors were green and blue, which you two colors were blue and red, which mix together to make magenta.15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  21915</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2197/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 220You can see this in action by taking any RGB image (pretty much any JPG  individual channels in the  .FIGURE 8-27 An RGB image (top left) with (going clockwise) the Red, Blue, and Green channels turned  shows how colors interact in the RGB model.Mike Baird (http:// ickr.com/ people/mikebaird/)How hexadecimal represents RGB is interaction of light is the foundation of the hexadecimal color notation that powers the web.

Well, any two inks (other than black) in the CMYK model essentially mix together to create red, green, or blue. When cyan, magenta, and yellow inks are mixed together, it blocks almost all the light and creates a color very close to black. Black ink is added to the mixture to save ink, add more depth, or render type more crisply.FIGURE 8-36 How cyan, magenta, and yellow ink – part of the subtractive CMYK color model – mix.Clearly there is some overlap between the color capabilities of the RGB and CMYK color models, but there are some incompatibilities between the two models as well. Both the RGB and CMYK color models have their own unique limitations in what colors they can reproduce. Additionally, there are bounds to the colors that can be perceived by the human visual system. Understanding the limitations of human vision, within the context of limitations of a particular color model, is key to working with color accurately.Color gamuts e boundaries of the color capabilities of a particular color capture or color reproduction system – whether it is that of human vision, a computer monitor, 15<em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  22715</em>9781119998952-ch08.indd  2277/27/11  6:37 PM 7/27/11  6:37 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 228gamut. e colors present in the gamut of one system aren’t always present within another, so these inconsistencies are compensated for through the process of color management.To keep color representations consistent as they move from one gamut to another, gamuts are described by les. les (built on standards created by the International Color Consortium) hold data that describes how le connection space (PCS).  le is the Lab color space that I described earlier. e RGB color model (represented by the Adobe RGB and sRGB color spaces) is generally for digital cameras and monitors, and the CMYK color model is for printers.

Although we have some psychological reactions to color that stem from prehistoric life, colors carry meanings that  er across cultures and from person to person. Additionally, color is contextual: A color that may connote positive feelings in one context may have ect in another context. Still, in pursuit of beautiful aesthetics, a great deal of thought and practice has been applied toward understanding and bringing structure to how colors interact to establish a particular mood or feeling. By understanding how colors interact, and what factors are at play in giving color meaning, you can begin to use color well.To begin to understand color, you need to understand how humans have been conditioned to react over time to certain colors. Additionally, there are some ese factors have worked together throughout the establishment of various cultures to attach particular meanings to colors over time, causing color associations to er across audiences. On the web, however, some conventional uses of color have begun to emerge that sometimes cross cultural boundaries. Aside from more explicit color communication, some formulaic color relationships have been studied by artists and theorists over time that contribute to implicitly creating a mood or feeling in a design.In this chapter, I’ll explain how you can use color to create beautiful design, while communicating clearly to your audience. I’ll introduce you to some theories about how color signals that helped early humans survive have lived on ect us psychologically and have become ingrained in our cultures. I’ll outline some of the cultural factors to consider when designing for an audience from an unfamiliar culture, and explain some color usages that have become conventional in web design. Finally, I’ll explain some common color relationships that can help you choose colors that go together well.Like most things in design, there is no one right way to use color. But armed with this thought framework through which you can examine color in your own design work and the work of others, you can begin to use color with purpose, instead of just guessing or hoping to one day receive a divine gift of impeccable color intuition.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  23616</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2367/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMCHAPTER NINE COLOR THEORY 237Color Response throughout Human HistoryColor meanings vary across cultures and from person to person. Most people’s associations with particular colors have been formed over time. When we’re exposed to particular colors in certain contexts, we tend to associate colors with those things.

It’s generally believed that we react in a relaxed manner to colors on the “cool” end of the visible spectrum (violet, blue, and green), while “warm” colors ect. e short-wavelength cones that detect the cool portions of the visible spectrum are outnumbered by both the middle- and long-wavelength cones, which overlap in detecting the warmer portions of the visible spectrum. Additionally, short-wavelength cones are completely absent from the fovea, which is the center of our visual focus, where we can best see detail.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  237 16</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2377/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 238 ect of blue and other “cool” colors is due, in part, to the fact that they simply stimulate our visual system less.   nd a physiological response to blue, results have been mixed.

But a powerful key may be as simple as the color of Target’s branding: red. Research has shown that red, in certain contexts, can reduce your ability to reason and make wise decisions – and oor to ceiling in red. The effect of red on your brain e power of red was exposed by researchers Andrew J. Elliot and Markus A. Maier, of the University of Rochester and University of Munich, respectively. ey found that exposure to red can overload your brain’s executive functioning   e most amazing part of this is  ect without your having any clue that it’s happening. Elliot and Maier conducted a series of experiments in which participants were given various cognitive skills tests – such as an anagram puzzle (rearranging erence among participants being the colors the tests were presented in: red, green, or gray.In one study, participants were told that they were going to take an IQ test.

When given the choice of what test questions to take, the group exposed to the red test chose the test questions that were rated easier. Participants showed avoidance with their body language: Sensors attached to the participants revealed that those who were presented with a red-covered test on a table actually moved their bodies farther away from the test than the other participants did. Finally, the participants who took IQ tests with red covers actually scored lower on the tests than participants who were presented with tests with green or gray covers.Apparently, just by mere exposure to the color red, participants were fear- eir prefrontal cortexes were overloaded, and, as a result, they were unable to perform the complex tasks of an IQ test as well as they might have otherwise. Subconsciously, they were aware that their performance was hindered (as evinced by their avoidant body language and their choices to take easier test questions), but when they were asked to consciously rate their own performance, it turned out that they weren’t aware of any of it. All the avoidance, the physiological responses of their brains, and their reduced ey rated their own performances just as well as did participants who were presented with tests that had green or gray covers.The attack on your prefrontal cortex ndings of Elliot and Maier hold true in everyday life, then the reason we have so much trouble monitoring our spending inside a Target store starts to make more sense.

Color and contextOne big distinction between Elliot and Maier’s IQ test study and shopping at a Target store is that of context. Just like anything else, the meaning of, and our er depending on the context. Take for example the role of red from an evolutionary standpoint.

You’ll rarely see blue in branding for food companies, just as you’ll rarely see blue in any natural foods (unless the food is spoiled and caked with mold).Red is used much less often in branding for banks.

Chase, Wachovia, TD Ameritrade, and Citibank all have green or blue as dominant colors in their branding. Red is still not unheard of in bank branding, but its use is usually restricted to small “accent” areas. Anyone who has looked at the interface for his stock portfolio or bank account and seen numbers in red can attest to the fact that, when money is involved, red is not a good color.Whatever the context of red – between Elliot and Maier’s research, and the anecdotal evidence of use of red in romantic and food-related settings – you ect. It reduces our ability to reason and – at least a little bit – brings out the animal in us. Who amongst us hasn’t pursued a lover to later regret it or gone on a junk food binge that we wish we hadn’t? Red is the most powerful color of all, so use it wisely.What this means to youSo, how can you use this newfound knowledge of red to make your design work better? Here are a few ways:> Use red in contexts where you want to drive user behavior forward. If you’re showing a sale price, a call-to-action button such as “Buy Now,” or er ends, red will create a sense of urgency and cue your users to act.> Use red in error messages and other urgent notes. Red will immediately alert your user that something is up and will make your message look important.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  244 16</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2447/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMCHAPTER NINE COLOR THEORY 245> Consider using red if you’re doing any work related to food. Red is associated with food and has worked well with many food companies and restaurants. Avoid strong use of blue in these contexts, however – it’s ect on appetite. > Avoid red in performance-based contexts. If you’re creating a quiz application, red may interfere with the performance of your users.Research on Other ColorsAside from the research that has been conducted on the color red, there is little ect on humans.  ects of certain colors have been found in a variety of situations.

But if you’re designing for a culture that you’re unfamiliar with, or if you’re designing for an international audience, it’s a good idea to do some research on colors that are important to a particular culture before designing for them.When designing for an unfamiliar culture, trying to choose colors wisely is a bit like having a conversation with someone you’ve just met at a party.

Making paint was a labor-intensive process that involved the use of expensive pigments, so it was economical to be able to make as many colors as 16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  247 16</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2477/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 248possible from as few colors as possible. From this, the now well-known and popular artist’s color wheel was born. es three colors – red, yellow, and blue – as primary colors. For centuries, artists have been able to create nearly any color they wanted from these three pigments, so it was believed that all colors came from these colors.You probably learned in preschool that red and yellow make orange, yellow and ese colors, which result from mixing any two primary colors, are called the secondary colors.million colors, so we certainly can’t stop with the primary and secondary colors. If you mix one of these primary colors with the adjacent secondary color, you get another set of colors called tertiary colors. ese colors together – the primary, secondary, and tertiary colors – make up  cally correct.

Here are a few patterns that you see often in color usage on the web.Backgrounds e color choice that will have the most impact on your design is that of the background color of your site or application. Choosing your background color is like choosing the stock of paper on which you print your résumé. Brilliant white, hot pink, or cream-colored paper all have impact, each in its own way, erent background colors on your website.WhiteWeb designs with predominantly white backgrounds are, without a doubt, the most common on the web. Most people are used to reading material – such as newspapers or magazines – that are printed on white paper. A white background, when used with dark type, provides good contrast for reading and conveys a sense of trustworthiness. White is associated with purity, cleanliness, and innocence in Western cultures. Even though some Eastern cultures, such as India and China, often wear white to funerals, white is still used on popular websites in those countries. Google, Guruji (an Indian search engine), and Baidu (a Chinese search engine) all use white backgrounds. e more widespread the audience of a website, the more likely it is to have a white background. White can be considered a standard on e-commerce websites, and it’s a good idea not to waver from this standard.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  24916</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2497/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 250Off-white -white color is   c  -white or cream colors often are associated with things that have a natural feel to them.

Dark backgrounds can provide a sense of exclusivity and sophistication.Bright nitely make an impact, but that won’t always be a good thing.

Understanding patterns in color usage on the web can help you make quick decisions that communicate clearly to your users. Here are some common usages for colors in web design.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25116</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2517/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 252Green ere are a number of icons and interface elements that often show up green. A green checkmark is often used in product comparison charts to indicate that a product has a particular feature. A message that indicates that something has been successfully completed is often shown in green. Green is also a popular color for call-to-action buttons and sometimes tests better than other colors; red often performs well, too. (See FIGURE 9-5 Green is often used in contexts of progress or success.YellowSince most of us have – at some point – used a yellow-colored highlighter to highlight important passages in a book, yellow is often used in website design to call attention to important messages or notes. YouTube uses yellow when you’re viewing one of your own videos to let you know that the video is private. Basecamp project management software uses a light yellow background to call attention to important notes on its signup form. Google products, such as Gmail, use a yellow background to highlight important messages.Yellow is also often associated with sales, deals, and prices. Amazon.com uses a yellow “treasure chest” icon to highlight “Today’s Deals,” as well a yellow stars for its rating system and yellow call-to-action buttons on its product pages. e highest-paying bidders on Google keywords have the privilege of having their 16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  252 16</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2527/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMCHAPTER NINE COLOR THEORY 253RedRed is often used on the web in contexts when there is an error or other urgent message that it’s critical for the user to see. Most forms display errors in red, for example. Red also can be powerful for urgent marketing messages. eBay uses red to indicate that an auction is ending soon, Amazon.com uses red to display its discounted prices, and the analytics company Performable conducted one test in which it found that a red call-to-action button outperformed a green Performable’s branding is green, so red also contrasted heavily with that.) (See FIGURE 9-6 Yellow is often used to highlight important information, or to signal that something is special.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25316</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2537/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 254FIGURE 9-7 Red is usually used in contexts where an error has occurred, urgent information is being displayed, or user action is desired.BlueBlue is the standard color for link text on the web – so much so that some web designers refuse to use any link color other than some form of blue.

For example, Performable’s red call-to-action button performed better, in part, because it contrasted with its green color scheme. If you have a site with a predominantly blue color scheme, your blue links aren’t going to stand out as much. Also, imagine if you tried to put a yellow “alert” note on the TXP Mobile site – it wouldn’t be noticed at all!16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25416</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2547/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMCHAPTER NINE COLOR THEORY 255 is is something to keep in mind when using a color that is intended to attract attention in some way, to accompany important information, or to indicate that an important event has occurred. It won’t get noticed if it doesn’t contrast with its surroundings.The Interaction of Colors: Why Monet Never Used BlackTo better understand how colors interact, it’s helpful to study the work of a group of painters who became obsessed with colors and how they interact. As the popular tendency toward realism began to be rejected by the avant-garde, the Impressionists experimented with color, exposing the inherent qualities of their medium, and Claude Monet is one of the better known of the Impressionists.  the canvas with color and contrast, but Monet somehow managed to avoid using the color black for nearly his entire painting career. By understanding how Monet used color, you can better understand how colors interact and use that knowledge to create a similar sense of life and depth in your own design work.Monet, and other Impressionists, experimented obsessively with his medium: paint, some brushes, and canvas. So, just as pixels prohibit the use of e inherent qualities of oil paint (thick and viscous), paint brushes (just a bunch of hair on a stick), and sometimes the texture of the canvas itself, lent themselves well to paintings being much more blurry than the more realistic paintings that were popular at the time. Realist painters strived to make these qualities invisible, but the Impressionists embraced them, much like pixel or bitmap fonts embrace the qualities of the pixel.In the course of this experimentation, Impressionists had to experiment with  ects. Much like a rich-colored image is dithered creating the illusion of a color by placing colors next to each other. Colors next to each other would then optically mix, making them appear as another overall color when viewed from a distance.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25516</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2557/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 256The Impressionists: Masters of color is  ect was experimented with further until it became the major focus of some Impressionist painters as a technique called pointillism, which involves  erent overall color.

As I described earlier, the color wheel is made up of primary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors. But there is an imaginary division in the color wheel, which separates “cool” (green, blue, and purple) and “warm” colors (red, orange, and yellow).16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25616</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2567/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMCHAPTER NINE COLOR THEORY 257 ese colors are referred to as such because warm colors give a sense of warmth –  ect – to the viewer, while cool colors give a sense of cool –  ect. Culturally, this makes sense: We tend to associate yellow,  re, while we associate blue with water or ice.

To create a more sophisticated color, a hue is tinted or shaded. A tint of a hue is basically a lighter version of that hue. If you were mixing paint, you would just be adding white. A shade is a darker version of the base hue. If you were mixing paint, you would essentially be adding black to create a darker version of the hue.Tints pop, shades recedeIt’s probably no surprise to you that – much as warm hues pop and cool hues same color of blue as the backdrop, a tinted square of the blue pops, while a shaded square recedes.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  25716</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2577/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 258FIGURE 9-10 e tinted blue square pops, and the shaded blue square recedes.The importance of contextBut will that tinted blue square always pop?

Meanwhile, the center part of the tree is a warm, but dark brown, based on an orange hue. Because the main part of the tree is a warmer color, this gives the tree some dimension, making the trunk jut out toward you, while the edges recede.Additionally, the sky and the leaves of the tree in the background are both  is creates the maximum possible color contrast between the sky and the edges of the tree, and creates a sense of the kind of blurry vibration that we might expect when viewing an object against a black background.16<em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  26116</em>9781119998952-ch09.indd  2617/27/11  6:36 PM 7/27/11  6:36 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 262FIGURE 9-16 Delicate changes in color relationships give the tree trunk dimension and cause the sky to shine around the tree trunk.Using color like MonetMonet’s painting is a pretty extreme example, with very vibrant colors.

A typeface (or type or face) is how the type looks, and a font le containing the typeface. Many purists are sticklers about the proper usage of these two terms, but for the sake of familiarity, I use the word font whenever it isn’t grossly inaccurate. It’s true that design decisions are technically based upon a typeface, but you choose a font to display that typeface. Chances are, you have more important things to worry about than the difference between these two terms.18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  29418</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  2947/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMAPPENDIX A CHOOSING AND PAIRING FONTS 295mix of forms from punchcutting and scripture, the forms of transitional types ey feature heavily modulated strokes, with strong variations between thick and thin, an upright axis, and sharply modeled serifs.FIGURE A-3 Transitional typefaces are a  stronger departure  from scribed  lettering than old  style faces are.  ey’re somewhat geometrically  rationalized, so  they feature  strongly  modulated  strokes, an  upright axis, and  sharply modeled  serifs.Baskerville Modernpush the limits of lead type with their extreme contrast between thick and thin.

Finding typefaces that go together  ere are some good rules of thumb for pairing faces, but there are exceptions. Truly understanding what makes types pair together can ensure that you make wise choices when you add fonts to your design.18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  29818</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  2987/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMAPPENDIX A CHOOSING AND PAIRING FONTS 299The rule icting “rules” about typography, the common advice to use no more than two fonts – one of them serif, and one sans-serif – is pretty sound. You can easily create a beautiful and family into the mix can provide dynamism and sophistication that may be hard to achieve with just one font. However, there isn’t much point in using two  erent sans-serif fonts. Mixing two serif or two sans-serif types can be confusing to the viewer; plus, it just doesn’t provide enough visual variety to justify the added complexity.In print applications, serif faces are generally regarded as more readable than sans-serif faces. So, if two fonts are being used, a sans-serif face is typically used for titles and headers, while a serif face is used for body copy. erent habits, however (see Chapter on-screen, so when a second font is used, it’s often a serif typeface for more sophisticated-looking headers and titles. guration – a sans-serif font for headers and titles, with a serif font for body copy – is certainly a viable option, provided that the serif face is one designed for the web (such as Georgia) and is displayed large enough to be readable.The exception to the ruleYou don’t always have to avoid using two serif or two sans-serif fonts in a design. For example, if you’re creating a design with just one sans-serif font, you’re likely to have portions of text that appear quite large (as subheads) and other text that appears quite small (as body text or detail text).In these cases, choosing a more nuanced face – designed for print – for the is is because many typefaces that are designed to be readable at body copy sizes on the web are generally not ey’re usually designed to have large counters, or are  ed to maintain the readability of the type at smaller sizes –  attering when displayed at larger sizes. 18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  299 18</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  2997/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 300www.daringfireball.net e larger portions of type – the titles of blog posts and the menu items, for example – are displayed in a more nuanced face, Gill Sans. Although the menu item faces aren’t very large, Gill Sans still wouldn’t read as well in body copy, so Verdana is used instead.FIGURE A-11 John Gruber’s website uses Verdana for readable body copy and Gill Sans for more interesting headers.Copyright © 2002–2011 John GruberBut this pairing is no accident. Verdana has a humanist letter structure that is quite similar to that of Gill Sans. But the giant counters and simplistic details that make Verdana read great at small sizes also make it look awkward and uninteresting at large sizes. Gill Sans is similar enough to Verdana so as to not be disturbing, but it has more character, making it a better candidate for larger titles and headers.It should be noted that the Daring Fireball logo is neither Gill Sans nor is kind of  erentiation between the typeface in the logo and the fonts in the rest of the design is standard and helps support the visual importance of the logo itself.18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  30018</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3007/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMAPPENDIX A CHOOSING AND PAIRING FONTS 301Why certain fonts pair wellTo understand what makes two fonts go together well, you need to understand e letter structures that I described  uence on how well two fonts go together, but other important characteristics include texture and character width.TextureTexture (sometimes called color er from one  uences the compatibility of two fonts. Texture is the overall look of a body of text in a given typeface. Type designers strive to have a generally even texture throughout a block of text. If you squint while looking at a block of text, no characters should stick out as too heavy or too light. If the texture of a block of type is even, then the letterforms themselves can be read more comfortably.Harmony versus contrastIf you pay attention to successful relationships and marriages, you may notice that both nish each other’s sentences, and they may even look alike. But other equally strong relationships are a study in contrasts: One person may be extroverted and creative, while the other is quiet and analytical. It’s as if both people in the relationship get to experience the world in a way they wouldn’t otherwise because of their partner.Successful font pairings are a lot like successful relationships in this way. Harmonious font pairings – where the typefaces share a number of attributes – can look beautiful, elegant, and clean. But fonts that heavily contrast with one another also can pair well, creating a sense of boldness. The approach you choose – harmony or contrast – all depends on the feeling you want to convey, but it’s the area in between these two approaches that you want to avoid. rst pairing are in harmony, the fonts in the third pairing contrast heavily, and the fonts in the second pairing are somewhere in between, making them look awkward together.When pairing fonts, it’s best to achieve harmony or contrast.We™re in harmony With each otherAdobe Garamond &#x26; Gill SansBaskerville &#x26; Gill Sans Bodoni Bold Condensed &#x26;Gill Sans LightWeÕre neither similar Nor different enough We™re so different We go together 18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  30118</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3017/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 302But just because two high-quality fonts have overall even textures in body copy er most notably in darkness versus lightness and roughness versus smoothness.Darkness versus lightness uenced by the overall visual weight of the individual letterforms, but also by the t, or how the forms of the letters relate to each other in the pursuit of an even e Tragedy of Misuse: Why You Hate Comic  t).Arial, because Arial Black has much thicker strokes.FIGURE A-12 Arial Black produces a much darker texture than that of Arial, but Lucida Grande – because of its t – produces a lighter texture than that of Arial.Arial Black Arial Lucida Grande But, even though Arial has similar stroke weights to Lucida Grande, Lucida t.

Font sizeYou may have noticed in the previous examples, that some of the typefaces actually appear to be larger than the others. Additionally, some of the samples have more visual white space vertically between the lines.The reality is that the fonts in all these examples are the exact same point size. As you can gure, some typefaces appear larger because the x-height (the height of a lowercase x) varies from one type to the next. The actual point size of a font is largely determined by the distance between the tallest ascender (such as the top of a lowercase b) and the lowest descender (such as the tail of a lowercase p).Various properties of a typeface, such as x-height, can change the face’s visual size.BaselineDescenderAdobe GaramondTimes New RomanVerdana x-heightCap heightAscenderBecause point size is a leftover concept from when type was set in lead, it actually refers to the overall height of the lead slugs the letters were on. So, there is sometimes some arbitrary extra space accounted for in the point size of a font. This is why the overall height from ascender to descender of Verdana is a bit more than in Times New Roman, even though both samples are the same point size.continued18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  30318</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3037/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 304Character widthCharacter width is pretty much what it sounds like: the width of the actual er in character width, this  ict between their overall letter structure (even if the base  erent character widths – one of the contributing factors to their not being a very strong pairing.FIGURE A-14 e  ering character widths between Verdana and Times New Roman contributes to their being a weak pairing. Adobe Garamond and Gill Sans have more similar character widths.continuedThe sample text blocks also have the same amount of leading (vertical space between lines). Leading gets its name from the time when printers were setting type by hand: They placed strips of lead between the lines of type to regulate the vertical space between them. Leading is also known in CSS as the line-height property.By regulating the leading of type, you can alter the overall darkness or lightness of texture in a block of text. As a good rule of thumb, body copy tends to be most readable when the leading is about 120 percent to 140 percent of the type size (a line-height of 1.2em to 1.4em). Smaller portions of text, such as within bulleted lists, tend to look better with a smaller line-height (1em or 1.1em).18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  304 18</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3047/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMAPPENDIX A CHOOSING AND PAIRING FONTS 305The n has itIf you’re unsure about the letter structure compatibility between two fonts, you can learn a great deal just from the lowercase n. gure, the forms of the n are repeated in the letters b, h, m, p, q (sometimes), r, and u, so the n gives you clues as to what the rest of the typeface looks like.In most typefaces – like  Helvetica – the  forms present  in the lowercase  n are repeated throughout  many characters  in the alphabet. gure, you can see how the n’s of Gill Sans, Futura, and Helvetica differ.

Because it’s a humanist face, its forms are more closely tied to the human body and nature.Contrast that with Futura, whose forms are geometrically rationalized. The shoulder of the n on Futura is nearly symmetrical, as if it were an arch on a doorway.Helvetica’s n lies somewhere in between these two extremes. The curve of its shoulder bends more deliberately, as if it were a piece of forged iron.continued18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  30518</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3057/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 306The ultimate cheat: Staying faithful to a typographer nd one that goes well with your favorite font, a good shortcut is to choose fonts that are created by the same type designer. Designing typefaces is a painstaking and all-consuming process, so type designers tend to have their own distinct philosophies about what makes a good typeface.Most people don’t pay any attention at all to who designed the font they’re using, but they really should. Designing type is a highly skilled craft, and it pays to respect and understand the backgrounds of those who design your typefaces.Say, for example, that you really love Gill Sans – the Humanist structure gives your design an approachable and friendly feeling that’s perfect for your project. With a quick Google search, you could discover that Gill Sans was designed by Eric Gill, who also designed a serif face called Joanna. It’s a safe bet that Joanna goes well with Gill Sans.continued uence of n gure. The n’s of Gill Sans and Adobe Garamond are both humanist, so the typefaces are in harmony. But Times New Roman has a realist letter structure, so it doesn’t go quite as well with Gill Sans. e humanist letter structure of Adobe Garamond makes it pair better with Gill Sans than Times New Roman does.When trying to achieve harmony between two fonts, the n can give powerful clues as to how well two fonts pair together.18<em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  306 18</em>9781119998952-bapp01.indd  3067/27/11  6:35 PM 7/27/11  6:35 PMAPPENDIX A CHOOSING AND PAIRING FONTS 307Joanna has a similar humanist letter structure and is full of other subtleties, such as the stroke modulation on the upper part of the a, that make it harmonize with Gill Sans.FIGURE A-15 Joanna and Gill Sans, both designed by Eric Gill, convey the sensibilities of their designer and, thus, go together well.All the Fonts You’ll Ever NeedAs I said earlier, if you dedicated a lot of time to learning about all the nuances   ciently skilled to pick the right font for any situation from thousands of fonts.

My goal is simply to nd yourself in a situation that isn’t covered in this appendix, just remember these principles:> Typography exists to communicate language. Anything that hinders or interferes with this communication is undesirable.> Typographic form is derived from a mixture of medium and language. e inherent qualities of the medium should always be considered when making typographic decisions.> e aim of a typeface is to allow the inherent qualities of the individual letters to shine through, sometimes while conveying a particular mood. Letterforms should be in harmony with one another, and no particular letter should have qualities that cause it to stand out from its brothers and sisters.> e design of a typeface should be respected. Creating beautiful typefaces takes a lifetime of dedication and careful craftsmanship. Anything that alters the qualities of a typeface compromises its ability to communicate clearly.> An even texture is the aim of any block of body text. Body text is made to be consumed easily, and an evenness of texture is the most direct route to this goal.> erentiation between pieces of information should be appropriate to how it is consumed.

Today, anyone with access to a desktop-publishing program can bend,  t. Typefaces have been very carefully crafted, and their gentle forms are no mistake, so these practices should be avoided. Here are some of the most common ways that type is distorted.Fake boldFortunately, simply by designating font-weight: bold in CSS, you prompt the browser to select the correct font (if available), but there are many opportunities in desktop-publishing programs to use a fake bold version of a ese cially bolded fonts are essentially just the original version of the font, but  is removes all the subtlety from the forms of the letters and usually closes up small counterforms, reducing the legibility of the font.rendered as the authentic bold of a font.

When you use the CSS font-variant: small-caps property – even if there is an authentic small-caps version available – browsers 19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  31419</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3147/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMAPPENDIX B TYPOGRAPHIC ETIQUETTE 315will instead create fake small caps by replacing any lowercase letters within the element with smaller versions of capital letters.But isn’t this what small caps are? Actually, no. True small caps are custom-drawn to blend in well (creating an even texture) with the lowercase characters of a typeface. As a result, they will usually be just as tall as the x-height (the height of the lowercase x) of the typeface, and be made up of slightly bolder strokes than the capital letters of the typeface, while also standing a little bit FIGURE B-5 Authentic small caps more closely match the stroke width of a typeface’s capital letters.You may want to try avoiding using small caps altogether, but they can be a very useful tool in a skilled typographer’s arsenal for things like keeping acronyms such as HTML from dominating the text body and interrupting the ow for the reader. To avoid using these mangy-looking letters, you can use @font-face to select a font that actually has authentic small caps, and designate it in CSS without using the font-variant: small-caps property, like so:@font-face { font-family: “Adobe Garamond SC”; src: local(“Adobe Garamond SC”); }p abbr { font-family: “Adobe Garamond SC”; text-transform: lowercase; } Garamond (and most other fonts that are sophisticated enough to have dedicated small caps) has forms that are a bit too subtle to look readable at 19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  31519</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3157/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 316body copy sizes on the web. Web fonts, such as Georgia and Arial, don’t have dedicated small-caps versions available.So, another to solution is to out-fake the fakes. Since the main issue with fake small caps is that their strokes are too thin, you can simply bold the fake small caps to make them look a little more convincing. It also helps to ease up their letter spacing a bit to make the texture more similar to that produced by the standard lowercase letters. Here’s what that would look like:abbr, .smallcapssim { font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: .05em; }acronym, .smallcapssim span { font-weight: bold; }<p>The acronym &#x3C;abbr title=“HyperText Markup Language”>HTML</abbr> will blend in with the text better, as will the keyboard shortcut <span class=“smallcapssim”>C<span>trl</span> + A<span>lt</span> + D<span>elete</span></span></p>  ough the hacked fake small caps stand a bit too tall and narrow, they’re much less detectable than if they were just left alone.FIGURE B-6 Somewhat convincing small caps – which more closely match capitals in weight – can be generated with somestyling tricks.CSS Small CapsCSS Small Caps ÒFixedÓ ough generating such markup could be automated through jQuery or a plug-in for your particular web framework or CSS, this is, of course, pretty tedious. Like all matters of design and production, economics comes into play. , you may choose to pick your poison: Either let acronyms dominate your text body, or put up with emaciated small caps. Just be aware of why fake small caps are technically incorrect.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  31619</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3167/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMAPPENDIX B TYPOGRAPHIC ETIQUETTE 317Stretching typeFor various reasons, from time to time, a designer decides that he wants to alter the default nature of a typeface. Sometimes it’s because he wants a particular t within a particular space. Other times, he just feels like he’s adding some creativity to his design by doing so.Typefaces are designed with extreme care and skill, following forms that have been established over thousands of years. Stretching or distorting these delicately crafted forms is always a mistake. Always. cially compressed Helvetica  erent from those of Helvetica Condensed (you may need to look very  erences in the samples on the left side), which was actually designed to be narrow.

Use versions that are specially drawn instead.Helvetica Condensed Bold Helvetica Bold, distorted to be more narrow Helvetica Bold, severly distorted Helvetica Bold CSS’s font-stretch property purportedly allows you to distort type, but, fortunately, there is hardly any browser support for this property.Outlining type ere are some cases in which a designer may want to outline type. In most cases, it’s better to place type on an uninterrupted background that won’t interfere with the reader’s ability to consume the forms of the letters, but contrast outline on the type dramatically improves its legibility.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  31719</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3177/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 318FIGURE B-8 Carefully outlining type on busy backgrounds – such as in Google Maps – makes type more readable.Vector-drawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator make it easy for designers to create outlines on type that intrude upon the letterforms, thus hindering their legibility. It’s important to choose an option that places the outline just outside the edge of the letterforms. If the outline on the letter straddles the edge of the letterform, it will intrude on the letterform, as you can see in FIGURE B-9 If an outline around letters intrudes on the forms, it makes the text more  cult to read.

Placing text over a texture or image also makes it  cult to read. Placing text over images or textures is usually a bad idea as well. If this is necessary, try to pick a portion of the image, or a texture, that is low contrast. But make sure that the type contrasts well with this image or texture. If this is not an option, you may want to try an outline around the type as described in the preceding section.Setting Body CopyWhen setting a block of body text, your main goal should be to create an even e typographer’s job is to enable  the reader to consume the information as smoothly as possible.

Your sole goal when designating that a new paragraph has begun is simply to indicate that the previous paragraph has ended and that a new one has begun. An indentation or some space between the ending of one paragraph and the beginning of the next is all that is necessary to make this designation. Doing both is overkill and creates awkward and irregular chunks of white space.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  31919</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3197/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 320When indenting paragraphs, you don’t need to indent the opening paragraph of a  rst of that section, so doing so would be redundant.

You can easily implement it on blockquote elements; doing so gives them a more elegant look.Drop caps also can be cumbersome to create with CSS, but they can provide a nice visual anchor with which to lead the viewer into the text of an opening paragraph. Because the dropped cap is a larger size than the other text in the block, it tends to have negative spaces that need to be compensated for by FIGURE B-12 Drop caps have more presence – and give the text block a crisper border – when they’re hung into the margins visually, rather than constrained within an imaginary border.As with many things in typography, the considerate eye is a better judge of how far to hang punctuation than geometry or rationale.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  320 19</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3207/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMAPPENDIX B TYPOGRAPHIC ETIQUETTE 321To create a drop cap (which will work in Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, but not first-letter pseudo class, and carefully adjust the size, margins, and line-height so the drop cap is the  created as follows:p.opening:first-letter {  display: block;  float: left;   font-size: 114px;   line-height: 80px; /* Note that Firefox 3.x ignores line-height; this value is adjusted so that WebKit and Opera match Firefox. */  margin: 8px 5px 0 -6px;   padding:0;}Note that the irregular shape of the D rst line of the paragraph to be kerned closer to the drop cap, but even if there were a practical way to achieve the proper kerning for this instance, there is no practical way to do this with dynamic content (because you don’t always know what letter the drop cap would be kerned in a perfect world.FIGURE B-13 Although you can create a drop cap with some careful CSS, the  rst line won’t  always be properly kerned with the drop cap (left).

Many web frameworks and content management systems (CMSs) have plug-ins available to prevent widows and orphans.Tending to Typographic DetailsMany small typographic details have been cast aside as technology has changed, and others are just overlooked or highly debated. Giving careful consideration to each of these can produce beautiful typography.Plug-ins for your particular web framework or CMS can help handle some of this tedium, but ultimately, the decision is up to you whether a particular detail is worth it.Not all quotes are created equal e quotation marks that are produced when you type \" on your computer are not true quotation marks (unless your word-processing or page-layout program automatically generates otherwise). True quotes are known as smart quotes, and erent. To open a quotation, use “ (“), and to close a quotation, use ” (”).

You’ll most likely use ers such as  ne-tuned. Some people use hyphens as minus signs, although a longer character available in some fonts is intended for this use; this character more closely resembles an en dash than a hyphen.At the recommendation of Robert Bringhurst’s Elements of Typographic Style,  cial bible of the modern typographer, dashes used in text should be  is causes much less visual disruption than an em dash with no spaces (even though the em dash with no spaces is the rule in many editorial style books, including e Chicago Manual of Style) because there is less visual tension between the ends of the dash and the characters surrounding it, so it is less of an interruption to a smooth block of text. Additionally, it prevents long strings of characters that will bunch up when they cause a line break. e practice of using two hyphens (--) for dashes is leftover from typewriters and, besides being visually disruptive to the smooth text block, is unnecessary with the richer character set that is available to the interactive typographer.  anked with single spaces in this case. One space after a period, not twoVery few typographic arguments can match the intensity of that over whether there should be one space or two spaces after periods that end sentences.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  32419</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3247/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMAPPENDIX B TYPOGRAPHIC ETIQUETTE 325 is practice is left over from typographers from the Victorian era, which was an unenlightened period in more ways than just typography. Corsets and mutilating anti-masturbatory devices were eventually phased out, but corn akes and this poor habit have lived on. For those who are still skeptical, keep in mind that when a sentence ends, there is already a period, an entire space, and a capital letter to signal the end of one e addition of yet another space  ow of reading. e typist may still want to use two spaces after a period, but the typographer does not.Ligatures bring letters togetherWhen type was still set in lead, the lead slugs on which characters were set made it hard for some character pairs to be set closely enough. For example, in the letter combination , the top terminal of the f stuck out far enough that it couldn’t be set closely enough to the i, because of the dot on the i. So, many fonts (usually classic ones, such as Adobe Garamond) have ligatures for some pairings that actually meld the letterforms together. Some more modern fonts (such as Helvetica) also have ligatures, though no one will notice if you don’t use them. e left side shows type set without ligatures; the right  e visual tension is especially noticeable in the  and pairings of Adobe Garamond and Georgia; although Helvetica is erence between them and type that has been set without ligatures. Georgia does not have ligatures for the ,  , or  groupings.Obviously, it’s impractical to type ligatures whenever they may apply, and even if you did, you would run the risk of the content eventually being displayed with a font that isn’t equipped with the appropriate characters. So, plug-ins such as jQuery’s Ligature.js can automatically insert the most commonly supported ligatures where appropriate. But, be careful: Even if the proper characters are  cult for your users to use the Find command in 19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  325 19</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3257/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMDESIGN FOR HACKERS 326their browsers. At the time of this writing, Internet Explorer and WebKit-based browsers such as Chrome and Safari recognize ligatures as their corresponding letter pair when the Find command is used (that is, if a user is searching for the word g within the text of your page), whereas Firefox does not.font-variant-ligatures property displays the proper ligatures while not interfering with the actual HTML code of a page, thus retaining use of any browser’s Find command.

Because of the spotty browser support for ligatures, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to ignore ligatures altogether in body copy. Failure to use ligatures in large titles or headers may be more obvious, however; so, it may be worth picking your poison to support ligatures.19<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  327 19</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3277/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PM001011010110101010101101010100101010100101010100100100101010010010010010100101001001001010010110111010101001010010110111010101001010010101011011101010100101001010110101010111010101001010010101101010101010101010101001010010101101010101010101010010110100110010101101010101010101010010101010010010010010011010101010101010100101010100100100100101001011011101010101010100101001001001001001010010110111010101001001010100101001001001001001010010110111010101001010010101101010100100100100100101001011011101010100101001010110101010101010001001001001010010110111010101001010010101101010101010101010010100119<em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  328 19</em>9781119998952-bapp02.indd  3287/27/11  6:34 PM 7/27/11  6:34 PMIndexAaccent colors (website), 254–255active mood, creating with color, 280, 281–282 Adobe Garamond, 61, 308 Adobe Kuler, 285, 286 Adobe RGB, sRGB compared with, 230–231 AdWords (Google), 93, 94 aesthetic decisions, 18 afterimages, 200–201 AirBNB, 4, 26 alphabet, formation of, 47–50 Amazee Labs (website), 272–273 Amazon.com (website), 253 analogous color scheme, 266–268 Analytics (Google), 95 anchor text, content of, 100 ancient Greece, golden ratio in, 115–116 anti-aliasing, 43 AppleiPhone, 125, 126, 127 iPod and iPad, 26–28 Quartz technology, 85 Web 2.0 style, 83–85Aqua interfaceinfluence on web, 85–86 introduction of, 83–85 Web 2.0 and, 86–90Arial font, 62, 298, 302–303, 309 Art Nouveau, 60 Arts and Crafts Movement, 60 audience, finding your, 102 Augereau, Antoine (typographer), 66BBachata, 122, 123 background/foreground relationships.
